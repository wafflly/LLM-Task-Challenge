The verb 'rescues' is modified by the prepositional phrase 'from the burning building'.\nIn the second sentence, the noun 'dog' is modified by the prepositional phrase 'with a wagging tail'. The verb 'fetches' is modified by the prepositional phrase 'in the park'.\n\nHere are the word pairs between English and the language A: (a, tgt_a), (bravely, tgt_bravely), (building, tgt_building), (burning, tgt_burning), (dog, tgt_dog), (eagerly, tgt_eagerly), (fetches, tgt_fetches), (firefighter, tgt_firefighter), (from, tgt_from), (in, tgt_in), (kitten, tgt_kitten), (loyal, tgt_loyal), (park, tgt_park), (rescues, tgt_rescues), (smoke, tgt_smoke), (stick, tgt_stick), (tail, tgt_tail), (the, tgt_the), (thick, tgt_thick), (thrown, tgt_thrown), (trapped, tgt_trapped), (wagging, tgt_wagging), (with, tgt_with).\n\nWhat can we observe about the placement of prepositional phrases in relation to the noun they modify in Language A? Your answer should be based solely on the placement of prepositional phrases in relation to the noun they modify in the given sentence pairs. Do not infer the placement of prepositional phrases in relation to the noun they modify based on word order of other components in the sentences such as the order between verbs and their modifiers; for instance, do not use universal implicatures for inference. You can assume that each pair of sentences has the same syntactic structures, with the exception that word order may vary between children of a node in the syntactic structures. This means there are no translation divergences that alter the syntactic structure. Given this context, please determine the correct syntactic characteristic of Language A:\n\nA. Prepositional phrase can appear either before or after the modified noun\nB. Prepositional phrase appears only after the modified noun\nC. Prepositional phrase appears only before the modified noun\nD. Language A does not have prepositional phrases that modify the noun; it has only postpositional phrases\n\nTo respond, please provide your reasoning and indicate your final answer in brackets at the end of your response, for example [A].",
