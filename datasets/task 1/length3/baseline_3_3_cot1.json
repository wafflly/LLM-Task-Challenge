                "[Example Question]: What is the value of 677 / 426 * 329 - 143? \n[Answer]: Based on the elementary arithmetic, '*' and '/' have the same priority. They have higher priority over '+' and '-', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '*' and '/' have the same priority over '-', we evaluate them from left to right. In this case, '/' comes before '*', so we calculate '/' first: 677 / 426 = 1.5892018779342723, so the expression becomes 1.5892018779342723 * 329 - 143.\nStep2: Since '*' has priority over '-', we then calculate '*': 1.5892018779342723 * 329 = 522.8474178403756, so the expression becomes 522.8474178403756 - 143.\nStep3: Finally, 522.8474178403756 - 143 = 379.84741784037556, so the final answer is [379.84741784037556].\n\nWhat is the value of 562 / 690 * 678 - 18?
