They have higher priority over '+' and '-', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '*' and '/' have the same priority over '-', we evaluate them from left to right. In this case, '*' comes before '/', so we calculate '*' first: 9904 * 8911 = 88254544, so the expression becomes 8093 - 88254544 / 7736.\nStep2: Since '/' has priority over '-', we then calculate '/': 88254544 / 7736 = 11408.291623578076, so the expression becomes 8093 - 11408.291623578076.\nStep3: Finally, 8093 - 11408.291623578076 = -3315.291623578076, so the final answer is [-3315.291623578076].\n\nWhat is the value of 9499 - 7541 * 9435 / 8043? You can give the result as a decimal, and please put the final numeric result in brackets [], for example, [1].",

They have higher priority over '+' and '-', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '*' and '/' have the same priority over '-', we evaluate them from left to right.
