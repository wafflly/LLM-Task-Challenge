In this case, '*' comes before '/', so we calculate '*' first: 75 * 77 = 5775, so the expression becomes 24 - 5775 / 49.\nStep2: Since '/' has priority over '-', we then calculate '/': 5775 / 49 = 117.85714285714286, so the expression becomes 24 - 117.85714285714286.\nStep3: Finally, 24 - 117.85714285714286 = -93.85714285714286, so the final answer is [-93.85714285714286].\n\nWhat is the value of 84 - 23 * 71 / 41?
