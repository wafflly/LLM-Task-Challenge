They have higher priority over '+' and '-', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '/' has priority over '+' and '-', we evaluate '/' first: 7 / 4 = 1.75, so the expression becomes 6 - 8 + 1.75.\nStep2: Since '+' and '-' have the same priority, we evaluate them from left to right. In this case, '-' comes before '+', so we calculate '-' first: 6 - 8 = -2, so the expression becomes -2 + 1.75.\nStep3: Finally, -2 + 1.75 = -0.25, so the final answer is [-0.25].\n\nWhat is the value of 7 - 7 + 9 / 9?

In this case, '/' comes before '*', so we calculate '/' first: 8 / 3 = 2.6666666666666665, so the expression becomes 2.6666666666666665 - 1 * 4.\nStep2: Since '*' has priority over '-', we then calculate '*': 1 * 4 = 4, so the expression becomes 2.6666666666666665 - 4.\nStep3: Finally, 2.6666666666666665 - 4 = -1.3333333333333335, so the final answer is [-1.3333333333333335].\n\nWhat is the value of 7 / 3 - 7 * 6?

                "[Example Question]: What is the value of 5 / 8 * 9 - 5? \n[Answer]: Based on the elementary arithmetic, '*' and '/' have the same priority. They have higher priority over '+' and '-', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '*' and '/' have the same priority over '-', we evaluate them from left to right. In this case, '/' comes before '*', so we calculate '/' first: 5 / 8 = 0.625, so the expression becomes 0.625 * 9 - 5.\nStep2: Since '*' has priority over '-', we then calculate '*': 0.625 * 9 = 5.625, so the expression becomes 5.625 - 5.\nStep3: Finally, 5.625 - 5 = 0.625, so the final answer is [0.625].\n\nWhat is the value of 1 / 1 * 5 - 1? You can give the result as a decimal, and please put the final numeric result in brackets [], for example, [1].",

They have higher priority over '+' and '-', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '*' and '/' have the same priority over '-', we evaluate them from left to right.

They have higher priority over '+' and '-', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '/' has priority over '+' and '-', we evaluate '/' first: 6 / 9 = 0.6666666666666666, so the expression becomes 2 + 0.6666666666666666 - 9.\nStep2: Since '+' and '-' have the same priority, we evaluate them from left to right. In this case, '+' comes before '-', so we calculate '+' first: 2 + 0.6666666666666666 = 2.6666666666666665, so the expression becomes 2.6666666666666665 - 9.\nStep3: Finally, 2.6666666666666665 - 9 = -6.333333333333334, so the final answer is [-6.333333333333334].\n\nWhat is the value of 6 + 1 / 5 - 1?
