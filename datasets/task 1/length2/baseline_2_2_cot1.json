They have higher priority over '+' and '-', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '/' has priority over '+', we calculate '/' first: 54 / 93 = 0.5806451612903226, so the expression becomes 23 + 0.5806451612903226.\nNext, 23 + 0.5806451612903226 = 23.580645161290324, so the final answer is [23.580645161290324].\n\nWhat is the value of 25 + 88 / 24?
