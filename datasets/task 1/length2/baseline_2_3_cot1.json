            "[Example Question]: What is the value of 530 + 498 / 886? \n[Answer]: Based on the elementary arithmetic, '*' and '/' have the same priority. They have higher priority over '+' and '-', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '/' has priority over '+', we calculate '/' first: 498 / 886 = 0.5620767494356659, so the expression becomes 530 + 0.5620767494356659.\nNext, 530 + 0.5620767494356659 = 530.5620767494356, so the final answer is [530.5620767494356].\n\nWhat is the value of 632 + 125 / 776? You can give the result as a decimal, and please put the final numeric result in brackets [], for example, [1].",
