We test four options one by one.\nFor A: The value of 3 / 5 + 4 - 7 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '+' > '-' = '/', '+' has the highest priority, followed by '-' and '/', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '+' has the highest priority, we calculate '+' first: 5 + 4 = 9, so the expression becomes 3 / 9 - 7.\nStep2: Since '-' and '/' have the same priority. Now we evaluate the expression from left to right. 3 / 9 = 0.3333333333333333, so the expression becomes 0.3333333333333333 - 7.\nStep3: Finally, 0.3333333333333333 - 7 = -6.666666666666667, so this answer choice evaluates to -6.666666666666667.\n\nSimilarly, we evaluate the expressions in B, C, and D in the same way as we evaluate the expression in A.\nFor B: using the precedence rule of choice B: '/' = '+' > '-', the expression 3 / 5 + 4 - 7 evaluates to -2.4000000000000004\nFor C: using the precedence rule of choice C: '+' > '/' = '-', the expression 3 / 5 + 4 - 7 evaluates to -6.666666666666667\nFor D: using the precedence rule of choice D: '-' > '+' > '/', the expression 3 / 5 + 4 - 7 evaluates to 1.5\nGiven above, only with choice B, the expression evaluates to -2.4000000000000004, so the correct answer should be [B]\n\nFor the expression 5 / 1 - 8 + 5, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

In this case, '+' comes before '*', so we calculate '+' first: 9 + 4 = 13, so the expression becomes 13 / 6 * 2.\nStep2: '*' has priority over '/'.

We test four options one by one.\nFor A: The value of 8 / 3 * 6 + 8 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '*' = '+' > '/', '*' and '+' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '/'\nStep1: Since '*' and '+' have the same priority over /, we evaluate '*' and '+' from left to right. In this case, '*' comes before '+', so we calculate '*' first: 3 * 6 = 18, so the expression becomes 8 / 18 + 8.\nStep2: '+' has priority over '/'. Now we calculate '+': 18 + 8 = 26, so the expression becomes 8 / 26.\nStep3: Finally, 8 / 26 = 0.3076923076923077, so this answer choice evaluates to 0.3076923076923077.\n\nSimilarly, we evaluate the expressions in B, C, and D in the same way as we evaluate the expression in A.\nFor B: using the precedence rule of choice B: '/' = '+' > '*', the expression 8 / 3 * 6 + 8 evaluates to 37.33333333333333\nFor C: using the precedence rule of choice C: '/' = '*' > '+', the expression 8 / 3 * 6 + 8 evaluates to 24.0\nFor D: using the precedence rule of choice D: '*' > '/' > '+', the expression 8 / 3 * 6 + 8 evaluates to 8.444444444444445\nGiven above, only with choice C, the expression evaluates to 24.0, so the correct answer should be [C]\n\nFor the expression 6 / 2 * 9 + 3, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

'-' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '/' has the highest priority, we calculate '/' first: 8 / 7 = 1.1428571428571428, so the expression becomes 2 * 6 - 1.1428571428571428.\nStep2: Since '*' has priority over '-', we then calculate '*': 2 * 6 = 12, so the expression becomes 12 - 1.1428571428571428.\nStep3: Finally, 12 - 1.1428571428571428 = 10.857142857142858, so this answer choice evaluates to 10.857142857142858.\n\nSimilarly, we evaluate the expressions in B, C, and D in the same way as we evaluate the expression in A.\nFor B: using the precedence rule of choice B: '/' = '-' > '*', the expression 2 * 6 - 8 / 7 evaluates to -0.5714285714285714\nFor C: using the precedence rule of choice C: '-' > '*' > '/', the expression 2 * 6 - 8 / 7 evaluates to -0.5714285714285714\nFor D: using the precedence rule of choice D: '*' > '-' > '/', the expression 2 * 6 - 8 / 7 evaluates to 0.5714285714285714\nGiven above, only with choice D, the expression evaluates to 0.5714285714285714, so the correct answer should be [D]\n\nFor the expression 5 - 4 * 7 / 5, the precedence of the operators is redefined.
