'+' = '-' = '*'\n\n[Answer]: \nUsing the precedence rule in the correct answer choice, the expression 3 + 4 - 5 * 9 should evaluate to 18. We test four options one by one.\nFor A: The value of 3 + 4 - 5 * 9 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '-' > '*' > '+', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '*'. '+' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '-' has the highest priority, we calculate '-' first: 4 - 5 = -1, so the expression becomes 3 + -1 * 9.\nStep2: Since '*' has priority over '+', we then calculate '*': -1 * 9 = -9, so the expression becomes 3 + -9.\nStep3: Finally, 3 + -9 = -6, so this answer choice evaluates to -6.\n\nFor B: The value of 3 + 4 - 5 * 9 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '*' > '-' > '+', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '-'. '+' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '*' has the highest priority, we calculate '*' first: 5 * 9 = 45, so the expression becomes 3 + 4 - 45.\nStep2: Since '-' has priority over '+', we then calculate '-': 4 - 45 = -41, so the expression becomes 3 + -41.\nStep3: Finally, 3 + -41 = -38, so this answer choice evaluates to -38.\n\nFor C: The value of 3 + 4 - 5 * 9 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '*' = '-' > '+', '*' and '-' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '+'\nStep1: Since '*' and '-' have the same priority over +, we evaluate '*' and '-' from left to right. In this case, '-' comes before '*', so we calculate '-' first: 4 - 5 = -1, so the expression becomes 3 + -1 * 9.\nStep2: '*' has priority over '+'. Now we calculate '*': -1 * 9 = -9, so the expression becomes 3 + -9.\nStep3: Finally, 3 + -9 = -6, so this answer choice evaluates to -6.\n\nFor D: The value of 3 + 4 - 5 * 9 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '+' = '-' = '*', +, -, and * have the same priority,so we can evaluate the expression from left to right\nStep1: Firstly, we calculate '+': 3 + 4 = 7, so the expression becomes 7 - 5 * 9.\nStep2: Then we calculate '-': 7 - 5 = 2, so the expression becomes 2 * 9.\nStep3: Finally, 2 * 9 = 18, so this answer choice evaluates to 18.\n\nGiven above, only with choice D, the expression evaluates to 18, so the correct answer should be [D]\n\nFor the expression 7 + 6 * 9 - 5, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

Now we evaluate the expression from left to right. 2 / 6 = 0.3333333333333333, so the expression becomes 0.3333333333333333 - 45.\nStep3: Finally, 0.3333333333333333 - 45 = -44.666666666666664, so this answer choice evaluates to -44.666666666666664.\n\nFor B: The value of 2 / 6 - 5 * 9 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '/' = '-' = '*', /, -, and * have the same priority,so we can evaluate the expression from left to right\nStep1: Firstly, we calculate '/': 2 / 6 = 0.3333333333333333, so the expression becomes 0.3333333333333333 - 5 * 9.\nStep2: Then we calculate '-': 0.3333333333333333 - 5 = -4.666666666666667, so the expression becomes -4.666666666666667 * 9.\nStep3: Finally, -4.666666666666667 * 9 = -42.0, so this answer choice evaluates to -42.0.\n\nFor C: The value of 2 / 6 - 5 * 9 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '*' = '/' > '-', '*' and '/' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '-'\nStep1: Since '*' and '/' have the same priority over -, we evaluate '*' and '/' from left to right. In this case, '/' comes before '*', so we calculate '/' first: 2 / 6 = 0.3333333333333333, so the expression becomes 0.3333333333333333 - 5 * 9.\nStep2: '*' has priority over '-'. Now we calculate '*': 5 * 9 = 45, so the expression becomes 0.3333333333333333 - 45.\nStep3: Finally, 0.3333333333333333 - 45 = -44.666666666666664, so this answer choice evaluates to -44.666666666666664.\n\nFor D: The value of 2 / 6 - 5 * 9 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '-' > '*' = '/', '-' has the highest priority, followed by '*' and '/', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '-' has the highest priority, we calculate '-' first: 6 - 5 = 1, so the expression becomes 2 / 1 * 9.\nStep2: Since '*' and '/' have the same priority. Now we evaluate the expression from left to right. 2 / 1 = 2.0, so the expression becomes 2.0 * 9.\nStep3: Finally, 2.0 * 9 = 18.0, so this answer choice evaluates to 18.0.\n\nGiven above, only with choice B, the expression evaluates to -42.0, so the correct answer should be [B]\n\nFor the expression 6 - 8 / 9 * 7, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

                "[Example Question]: \nFor the expression 5 / 5 * 3 - 3, the precedence of the operators is redefined. If 5 / 5 * 3 - 3 = 0.0, what is the redefined precedence of the operators? Please choose the correct answer from A, B, C, and D, and put the final answer choice in brackets, for example, [B].\nA. '*' > '/' > '-'\nB. '*' > '-' = '/'\nC. '/' = '*' > '-'\nD. '*' = '-' > '/'\n\n[Answer]: \nUsing the precedence rule in the correct answer choice, the expression 5 / 5 * 3 - 3 should evaluate to 0.0. We test four options one by one.\nFor A: The value of 5 / 5 * 3 - 3 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '*' > '/' > '-', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '/'. '-' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '*' has the highest priority, we calculate '*' first: 5 * 3 = 15, so the expression becomes 5 / 15 - 3.\nStep2: Since '/' has priority over '-', we then calculate '/': 5 / 15 = 0.3333333333333333, so the expression becomes 0.3333333333333333 - 3.\nStep3: Finally, 0.3333333333333333 - 3 = -2.6666666666666665, so this answer choice evaluates to -2.6666666666666665.\n\nFor B: The value of 5 / 5 * 3 - 3 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '*' > '-' = '/', '*' has the highest priority, followed by '-' and '/', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '*' has the highest priority, we calculate '*' first: 5 * 3 = 15, so the expression becomes 5 / 15 - 3.\nStep2: Since '-' and '/' have the same priority. Now we evaluate the expression from left to right. 5 / 15 = 0.3333333333333333, so the expression becomes 0.3333333333333333 - 3.\nStep3: Finally, 0.3333333333333333 - 3 = -2.6666666666666665, so this answer choice evaluates to -2.6666666666666665.\n\nFor C: The value of 5 / 5 * 3 - 3 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '/' = '*' > '-', '/' and '*' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '-'\nStep1: Since '/' and '*' have the same priority over -, we evaluate '/' and '*' from left to right. In this case, '/' comes before '*', so we calculate '/' first: 5 / 5 = 1.0, so the expression becomes 1.0 * 3 - 3.\nStep2: '*' has priority over '-'. Now we calculate '*': 1.0 * 3 = 3.0, so the expression becomes 3.0 - 3.\nStep3: Finally, 3.0 - 3 = 0.0, so this answer choice evaluates to 0.0.\n\nFor D: The value of 5 / 5 * 3 - 3 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '*' = '-' > '/', '*' and '-' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '/'\nStep1: Since '*' and '-' have the same priority over /, we evaluate '*' and '-' from left to right. In this case, '*' comes before '-', so we calculate '*' first: 5 * 3 = 15, so the expression becomes 5 / 15 - 3.\nStep2: '-' has priority over '/'. Now we calculate '-': 15 - 3 = 12, so the expression becomes 5 / 12.\nStep3: Finally, 5 / 12 = 0.4166666666666667, so this answer choice evaluates to 0.4166666666666667.\n\nGiven above, only with choice C, the expression evaluates to 0.0, so the correct answer should be [C]\n\nFor the expression 3 / 2 * 3 - 9, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

We test four options one by one.\nFor A: The value of 4 + 9 / 6 - 8 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '-' > '/' = '+', '-' has the highest priority, followed by '/' and '+', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '-' has the highest priority, we calculate '-' first: 6 - 8 = -2, so the expression becomes 4 + 9 / -2.\nStep2: Since '/' and '+' have the same priority. Now we evaluate the expression from left to right. 4 + 9 = 13, so the expression becomes 13 / -2.\nStep3: Finally, 13 / -2 = -6.5, so this answer choice evaluates to -6.5.\n\nFor B: The value of 4 + 9 / 6 - 8 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '-' > '+' > '/', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '+'. '/' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '-' has the highest priority, we calculate '-' first: 6 - 8 = -2, so the expression becomes 4 + 9 / -2.\nStep2: Since '+' has priority over '/', we then calculate '+': 4 + 9 = 13, so the expression becomes 13 / -2.\nStep3: Finally, 13 / -2 = -6.5, so this answer choice evaluates to -6.5.\n\nFor C: The value of 4 + 9 / 6 - 8 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '+' > '/' > '-', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '/'. '-' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '+' has the highest priority, we calculate '+' first: 4 + 9 = 13, so the expression becomes 13 / 6 - 8.\nStep2: Since '/' has priority over '-', we then calculate '/': 13 / 6 = 2.1666666666666665, so the expression becomes 2.1666666666666665 - 8.\nStep3: Finally, 2.1666666666666665 - 8 = -5.833333333333334, so this answer choice evaluates to -5.833333333333334.\n\nFor D: The value of 4 + 9 / 6 - 8 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '/' = '-' > '+', '/' and '-' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '+'\nStep1: Since '/' and '-' have the same priority over +, we evaluate '/' and '-' from left to right. In this case, '/' comes before '-', so we calculate '/' first: 9 / 6 = 1.5, so the expression becomes 4 + 1.5 - 8.\nStep2: '-' has priority over '+'. Now we calculate '-': 1.5 - 8 = -6.5, so the expression becomes 4 + -6.5.\nStep3: Finally, 4 + -6.5 = -2.5, so this answer choice evaluates to -2.5.\n\nGiven above, only with choice C, the expression evaluates to -5.833333333333334, so the correct answer should be [C]\n\nFor the expression 6 + 1 / 5 - 1, the precedence of the operators is redefined.
