We test four options one by one.\nFor A: The value of 62 + 42 * 80 / 68 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '*' = '/' > '+', '*' and '/' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '+'\nStep1: Since '*' and '/' have the same priority over +, we evaluate '*' and '/' from left to right. In this case, '*' comes before '/', so we calculate '*' first: 42 * 80 = 3360, so the expression becomes 62 + 3360 / 68.\nStep2: '/' has priority over '+'. Now we calculate '/': 3360 / 68 = 49.411764705882355, so the expression becomes 62 + 49.411764705882355.\nStep3: Finally, 62 + 49.411764705882355 = 111.41176470588235, so this answer choice evaluates to 111.41176470588235.\n\nSimilarly, we evaluate the expressions in B, C, and D in the same way as we evaluate the expression in A.\nFor B: using the precedence rule of choice B: '*' > '+' = '/', the expression 62 + 42 * 80 / 68 evaluates to 50.3235294117647\nFor C: using the precedence rule of choice C: '/' > '*' > '+', the expression 62 + 42 * 80 / 68 evaluates to 111.41176470588235\nFor D: using the precedence rule of choice D: '+' > '*' > '/', the expression 62 + 42 * 80 / 68 evaluates to 122.3529411764706\nGiven above, only with choice D, the expression evaluates to 122.3529411764706, so the correct answer should be [D]\n\nFor the expression 98 * 43 + 29 / 25, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

We test four options one by one.\nFor A: The value of 64 - 27 + 93 / 98 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '/' = '-' > '+', '/' and '-' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '+'\nStep1: Since '/' and '-' have the same priority over +, we evaluate '/' and '-' from left to right. In this case, '-' comes before '/', so we calculate '-' first: 64 - 27 = 37, so the expression becomes 37 + 93 / 98.\nStep2: '/' has priority over '+'. Now we calculate '/': 93 / 98 = 0.9489795918367347, so the expression becomes 37 + 0.9489795918367347.\nStep3: Finally, 37 + 0.9489795918367347 = 37.94897959183673, so this answer choice evaluates to 37.94897959183673.\n\nSimilarly, we evaluate the expressions in B, C, and D in the same way as we evaluate the expression in A.\nFor B: using the precedence rule of choice B: '+' > '/' > '-', the expression 64 - 27 + 93 / 98 evaluates to 62.775510204081634\nFor C: using the precedence rule of choice C: '-' = '+' = '/', the expression 64 - 27 + 93 / 98 evaluates to 1.3265306122448979\nFor D: using the precedence rule of choice D: '+' > '/' = '-', the expression 64 - 27 + 93 / 98 evaluates to -0.5714285714285714\nGiven above, only with choice C, the expression evaluates to 1.3265306122448979, so the correct answer should be [C]\n\nFor the expression 28 - 20 + 71 / 64, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

'*' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '/' has the highest priority, we calculate '/' first: 84 / 92 = 0.9130434782608695, so the expression becomes 76 * 0.9130434782608695 + 29.\nStep2: Since '+' has priority over '*', we then calculate '+': 0.9130434782608695 + 29 = 29.91304347826087, so the expression becomes 76 * 29.91304347826087.\nStep3: Finally, 76 * 29.91304347826087 = 2273.391304347826, so this answer choice evaluates to 2273.391304347826.\n\nSimilarly, we evaluate the expressions in B, C, and D in the same way as we evaluate the expression in A.\nFor B: using the precedence rule of choice B: '/' = '+' > '*', the expression 76 * 84 / 92 + 29 evaluates to 2273.391304347826\nFor C: using the precedence rule of choice C: '*' > '/' > '+', the expression 76 * 84 / 92 + 29 evaluates to 98.3913043478261\nFor D: using the precedence rule of choice D: '/' > '*' > '+', the expression 76 * 84 / 92 + 29 evaluates to 98.39130434782608\nGiven above, only with choice C, the expression evaluates to 98.3913043478261, so the correct answer should be [C]\n\nFor the expression 59 * 87 + 65 / 84, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

We test four options one by one.\nFor A: The value of 98 * 50 - 15 / 43 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '*' > '-' = '/', '*' has the highest priority, followed by '-' and '/', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '*' has the highest priority, we calculate '*' first: 98 * 50 = 4900, so the expression becomes 4900 - 15 / 43.\nStep2: Since '-' and '/' have the same priority. Now we evaluate the expression from left to right. 4900 - 15 = 4885, so the expression becomes 4885 / 43.\nStep3: Finally, 4885 / 43 = 113.6046511627907, so this answer choice evaluates to 113.6046511627907.\n\nSimilarly, we evaluate the expressions in B, C, and D in the same way as we evaluate the expression in A.\nFor B: using the precedence rule of choice B: '-' > '*' = '/', the expression 98 * 50 - 15 / 43 evaluates to 79.76744186046511\nFor C: using the precedence rule of choice C: '/' > '-' > '*', the expression 98 * 50 - 15 / 43 evaluates to 4865.813953488372\nFor D: using the precedence rule of choice D: '-' > '/' = '*', the expression 98 * 50 - 15 / 43 evaluates to 79.76744186046511\nGiven above, only with choice A, the expression evaluates to 113.6046511627907, so the correct answer should be [A]\n\nFor the expression 86 - 57 / 77 * 33, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

We test four options one by one.\nFor A: The value of 71 / 61 - 98 + 21 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '/' > '-' = '+', '/' has the highest priority, followed by '-' and '+', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '/' has the highest priority, we calculate '/' first: 71 / 61 = 1.1639344262295082, so the expression becomes 1.1639344262295082 - 98 + 21.\nStep2: Since '-' and '+' have the same priority. Now we evaluate the expression from left to right. 1.1639344262295082 - 98 = -96.8360655737705, so the expression becomes -96.8360655737705 + 21.\nStep3: Finally, -96.8360655737705 + 21 = -75.8360655737705, so this answer choice evaluates to -75.8360655737705.\n\nSimilarly, we evaluate the expressions in B, C, and D in the same way as we evaluate the expression in A.\nFor B: using the precedence rule of choice B: '+' > '/' = '-', the expression 71 / 61 - 98 + 21 evaluates to -117.8360655737705\nFor C: using the precedence rule of choice C: '+' = '/' > '-', the expression 71 / 61 - 98 + 21 evaluates to -117.8360655737705\nFor D: using the precedence rule of choice D: '+' > '-' > '/', the expression 71 / 61 - 98 + 21 evaluates to -1.2241379310344827\nGiven above, only with choice A, the expression evaluates to -75.8360655737705, so the correct answer should be [A]\n\nFor the expression 54 - 48 / 95 + 61, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

In this case, '-' comes before '/', so we calculate '-' first: 45 - 46 = -1, so the expression becomes -1 / 28 * 81.\nStep2: '/' has priority over '*'. Now we calculate '/': -1 / 28 = -0.03571428571428571, so the expression becomes -0.03571428571428571 * 81.\nStep3: Finally, -0.03571428571428571 * 81 = -2.892857142857143, so this answer choice evaluates to -2.892857142857143.\n\nSimilarly, we evaluate the expressions in B, C, and D in the same way as we evaluate the expression in A.\nFor B: using the precedence rule of choice B: '/' > '-' > '*', the expression 45 - 46 / 28 * 81 evaluates to 3511.928571428571\nFor C: using the precedence rule of choice C: '*' > '/' > '-', the expression 45 - 46 / 28 * 81 evaluates to 44.979717813051145\nFor D: using the precedence rule of choice D: '/' > '*' = '-', the expression 45 - 46 / 28 * 81 evaluates to 3511.928571428571\nGiven above, only with choice A, the expression evaluates to -2.892857142857143, so the correct answer should be [A]\n\nFor the expression 13 * 13 - 12 / 78, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

'/' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '-' has the highest priority, we calculate '-' first: 97 - 74 = 23, so the expression becomes 81 + 93 / 23.\nStep2: Since '+' has priority over '/', we then calculate '+': 81 + 93 = 174, so the expression becomes 174 / 23.\nStep3: Finally, 174 / 23 = 7.565217391304348, so this answer choice evaluates to 7.565217391304348.\n\nSimilarly, we evaluate the expressions in B, C, and D in the same way as we evaluate the expression in A.\nFor B: using the precedence rule of choice B: '-' > '+' = '/', the expression 81 + 93 / 97 - 74 evaluates to 7.565217391304348\nFor C: using the precedence rule of choice C: '/' > '-' > '+', the expression 81 + 93 / 97 - 74 evaluates to 7.958762886597938\nFor D: using the precedence rule of choice D: '+' > '/' = '-', the expression 81 + 93 / 97 - 74 evaluates to -72.20618556701031\nGiven above, only with choice D, the expression evaluates to -72.20618556701031, so the correct answer should be [D]\n\nFor the expression 19 - 21 + 98 / 41, the precedence of the operators is redefined.
