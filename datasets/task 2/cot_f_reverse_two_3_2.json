We test four options one by one.\nFor A: The value of 62 + 42 * 80 / 68 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '*' = '/' > '+', '*' and '/' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '+'\nStep1: Since '*' and '/' have the same priority over +, we evaluate '*' and '/' from left to right. In this case, '*' comes before '/', so we calculate '*' first: 42 * 80 = 3360, so the expression becomes 62 + 3360 / 68.\nStep2: '/' has priority over '+'. Now we calculate '/': 3360 / 68 = 49.411764705882355, so the expression becomes 62 + 49.411764705882355.\nStep3: Finally, 62 + 49.411764705882355 = 111.41176470588235, so this answer choice evaluates to 111.41176470588235.\n\nFor B: The value of 62 + 42 * 80 / 68 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '*' > '+' = '/', '*' has the highest priority, followed by '+' and '/', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '*' has the highest priority, we calculate '*' first: 42 * 80 = 3360, so the expression becomes 62 + 3360 / 68.\nStep2: Since '+' and '/' have the same priority. Now we evaluate the expression from left to right. 62 + 3360 = 3422, so the expression becomes 3422 / 68.\nStep3: Finally, 3422 / 68 = 50.3235294117647, so this answer choice evaluates to 50.3235294117647.\n\nFor C: The value of 62 + 42 * 80 / 68 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '/' > '*' > '+', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '*'. '+' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '/' has the highest priority, we calculate '/' first: 80 / 68 = 1.1764705882352942, so the expression becomes 62 + 42 * 1.1764705882352942.\nStep2: Since '*' has priority over '+', we then calculate '*': 42 * 1.1764705882352942 = 49.411764705882355, so the expression becomes 62 + 49.411764705882355.\nStep3: Finally, 62 + 49.411764705882355 = 111.41176470588235, so this answer choice evaluates to 111.41176470588235.\n\nFor D: The value of 62 + 42 * 80 / 68 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '+' > '*' > '/', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '*'. '/' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '+' has the highest priority, we calculate '+' first: 62 + 42 = 104, so the expression becomes 104 * 80 / 68.\nStep2: Since '*' has priority over '/', we then calculate '*': 104 * 80 = 8320, so the expression becomes 8320 / 68.\nStep3: Finally, 8320 / 68 = 122.3529411764706, so this answer choice evaluates to 122.3529411764706.\n\nGiven above, only with choice D, the expression evaluates to 122.3529411764706, so the correct answer should be [D]\n\nFor the expression 98 * 43 + 29 / 25, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

'*' > '+' > '-'\n\n[Answer]: \nUsing the precedence rule in the correct answer choice, the expression 91 * 90 - 44 + 24 should evaluate to 8170. We test four options one by one.\nFor A: The value of 91 * 90 - 44 + 24 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '-' > '*' > '+', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '*'. '+' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '-' has the highest priority, we calculate '-' first: 90 - 44 = 46, so the expression becomes 91 * 46 + 24.\nStep2: Since '*' has priority over '+', we then calculate '*': 91 * 46 = 4186, so the expression becomes 4186 + 24.\nStep3: Finally, 4186 + 24 = 4210, so this answer choice evaluates to 4210.\n\nFor B: The value of 91 * 90 - 44 + 24 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '*' > '-' = '+', '*' has the highest priority, followed by '-' and '+', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '*' has the highest priority, we calculate '*' first: 91 * 90 = 8190, so the expression becomes 8190 - 44 + 24.\nStep2: Since '-' and '+' have the same priority. Now we evaluate the expression from left to right. 8190 - 44 = 8146, so the expression becomes 8146 + 24.\nStep3: Finally, 8146 + 24 = 8170, so this answer choice evaluates to 8170.\n\nFor C: The value of 91 * 90 - 44 + 24 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '-' = '+' > '*', '-' and '+' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '*'\nStep1: Since '-' and '+' have the same priority over *, we evaluate '-' and '+' from left to right. In this case, '-' comes before '+', so we calculate '-' first: 90 - 44 = 46, so the expression becomes 91 * 46 + 24.\nStep2: '+' has priority over '*'. Now we calculate '+': 46 + 24 = 70, so the expression becomes 91 * 70.\nStep3: Finally, 91 * 70 = 6370, so this answer choice evaluates to 6370.\n\nFor D: The value of 91 * 90 - 44 + 24 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '*' > '+' > '-', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '+'. '-' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '*' has the highest priority, we calculate '*' first: 91 * 90 = 8190, so the expression becomes 8190 - 44 + 24.\nStep2: Since '+' has priority over '-', we then calculate '+': 44 + 24 = 68, so the expression becomes 8190 - 68.\nStep3: Finally, 8190 - 68 = 8122, so this answer choice evaluates to 8122.\n\nGiven above, only with choice B, the expression evaluates to 8170, so the correct answer should be [B]\n\nFor the expression 88 - 3 * 62 + 69, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

'/' > '*' > '+'\n\n[Answer]: \nUsing the precedence rule in the correct answer choice, the expression 76 * 84 / 92 + 29 should evaluate to 98.3913043478261. We test four options one by one.\nFor A: The value of 76 * 84 / 92 + 29 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '/' > '+' > '*', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '+'. '*' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '/' has the highest priority, we calculate '/' first: 84 / 92 = 0.9130434782608695, so the expression becomes 76 * 0.9130434782608695 + 29.\nStep2: Since '+' has priority over '*', we then calculate '+': 0.9130434782608695 + 29 = 29.91304347826087, so the expression becomes 76 * 29.91304347826087.\nStep3: Finally, 76 * 29.91304347826087 = 2273.391304347826, so this answer choice evaluates to 2273.391304347826.\n\nFor B: The value of 76 * 84 / 92 + 29 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '/' = '+' > '*', '/' and '+' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '*'\nStep1: Since '/' and '+' have the same priority over *, we evaluate '/' and '+' from left to right. In this case, '/' comes before '+', so we calculate '/' first: 84 / 92 = 0.9130434782608695, so the expression becomes 76 * 0.9130434782608695 + 29.\nStep2: '+' has priority over '*'. Now we calculate '+': 0.9130434782608695 + 29 = 29.91304347826087, so the expression becomes 76 * 29.91304347826087.\nStep3: Finally, 76 * 29.91304347826087 = 2273.391304347826, so this answer choice evaluates to 2273.391304347826.\n\nFor C: The value of 76 * 84 / 92 + 29 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '*' > '/' > '+', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '/'. '+' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '*' has the highest priority, we calculate '*' first: 76 * 84 = 6384, so the expression becomes 6384 / 92 + 29.\nStep2: Since '/' has priority over '+', we then calculate '/': 6384 / 92 = 69.3913043478261, so the expression becomes 69.3913043478261 + 29.\nStep3: Finally, 69.3913043478261 + 29 = 98.3913043478261, so this answer choice evaluates to 98.3913043478261.\n\nFor D: The value of 76 * 84 / 92 + 29 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '/' > '*' > '+', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '*'. '+' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '/' has the highest priority, we calculate '/' first: 84 / 92 = 0.9130434782608695, so the expression becomes 76 * 0.9130434782608695 + 29.\nStep2: Since '*' has priority over '+', we then calculate '*': 76 * 0.9130434782608695 = 69.39130434782608, so the expression becomes 69.39130434782608 + 29.\nStep3: Finally, 69.39130434782608 + 29 = 98.39130434782608, so this answer choice evaluates to 98.39130434782608.\n\nGiven above, only with choice C, the expression evaluates to 98.3913043478261, so the correct answer should be [C]\n\nFor the expression 59 * 87 + 65 / 84, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

We test four options one by one.\nFor A: The value of 69 / 23 * 84 - 19 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '/' = '*' = '-', /, *, and - have the same priority,so we can evaluate the expression from left to right\nStep1: Firstly, we calculate '/': 69 / 23 = 3.0, so the expression becomes 3.0 * 84 - 19.\nStep2: Then we calculate '*': 3.0 * 84 = 252.0, so the expression becomes 252.0 - 19.\nStep3: Finally, 252.0 - 19 = 233.0, so this answer choice evaluates to 233.0.\n\nFor B: The value of 69 / 23 * 84 - 19 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '*' > '-' = '/', '*' has the highest priority, followed by '-' and '/', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '*' has the highest priority, we calculate '*' first: 23 * 84 = 1932, so the expression becomes 69 / 1932 - 19.\nStep2: Since '-' and '/' have the same priority. Now we evaluate the expression from left to right. 69 / 1932 = 0.03571428571428571, so the expression becomes 0.03571428571428571 - 19.\nStep3: Finally, 0.03571428571428571 - 19 = -18.964285714285715, so this answer choice evaluates to -18.964285714285715.\n\nFor C: The value of 69 / 23 * 84 - 19 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '-' = '*' > '/', '-' and '*' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '/'\nStep1: Since '-' and '*' have the same priority over /, we evaluate '-' and '*' from left to right. In this case, '*' comes before '-', so we calculate '*' first: 23 * 84 = 1932, so the expression becomes 69 / 1932 - 19.\nStep2: '-' has priority over '/'. Now we calculate '-': 1932 - 19 = 1913, so the expression becomes 69 / 1913.\nStep3: Finally, 69 / 1913 = 0.03606900156821746, so this answer choice evaluates to 0.03606900156821746.\n\nFor D: The value of 69 / 23 * 84 - 19 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '-' > '/' > '*', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '/'. '*' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '-' has the highest priority, we calculate '-' first: 84 - 19 = 65, so the expression becomes 69 / 23 * 65.\nStep2: Since '/' has priority over '*', we then calculate '/': 69 / 23 = 3.0, so the expression becomes 3.0 * 65.\nStep3: Finally, 3.0 * 65 = 195.0, so this answer choice evaluates to 195.0.\n\nGiven above, only with choice A, the expression evaluates to 233.0, so the correct answer should be [A]\n\nFor the expression 25 / 61 - 18 * 35, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

'+' = '/' > '*'\n\n[Answer]: \nUsing the precedence rule in the correct answer choice, the expression 7 * 79 / 85 + 19 should evaluate to 25.50588235294118. We test four options one by one.\nFor A: The value of 7 * 79 / 85 + 19 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '/' = '+' > '*', '/' and '+' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '*'\nStep1: Since '/' and '+' have the same priority over *, we evaluate '/' and '+' from left to right. In this case, '/' comes before '+', so we calculate '/' first: 79 / 85 = 0.9294117647058824, so the expression becomes 7 * 0.9294117647058824 + 19.\nStep2: '+' has priority over '*'. Now we calculate '+': 0.9294117647058824 + 19 = 19.929411764705883, so the expression becomes 7 * 19.929411764705883.\nStep3: Finally, 7 * 19.929411764705883 = 139.50588235294117, so this answer choice evaluates to 139.50588235294117.\n\nFor B: The value of 7 * 79 / 85 + 19 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '+' > '*' > '/', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '*'. '/' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '+' has the highest priority, we calculate '+' first: 85 + 19 = 104, so the expression becomes 7 * 79 / 104.\nStep2: Since '*' has priority over '/', we then calculate '*': 7 * 79 = 553, so the expression becomes 553 / 104.\nStep3: Finally, 553 / 104 = 5.3173076923076925, so this answer choice evaluates to 5.3173076923076925.\n\nFor C: The value of 7 * 79 / 85 + 19 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '*' = '/' > '+', '*' and '/' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '+'\nStep1: Since '*' and '/' have the same priority over +, we evaluate '*' and '/' from left to right. In this case, '*' comes before '/', so we calculate '*' first: 7 * 79 = 553, so the expression becomes 553 / 85 + 19.\nStep2: '/' has priority over '+'. Now we calculate '/': 553 / 85 = 6.5058823529411764, so the expression becomes 6.5058823529411764 + 19.\nStep3: Finally, 6.5058823529411764 + 19 = 25.50588235294118, so this answer choice evaluates to 25.50588235294118.\n\nFor D: The value of 7 * 79 / 85 + 19 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '+' = '/' > '*', '+' and '/' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '*'\nStep1: Since '+' and '/' have the same priority over *, we evaluate '+' and '/' from left to right. In this case, '/' comes before '+', so we calculate '/' first: 79 / 85 = 0.9294117647058824, so the expression becomes 7 * 0.9294117647058824 + 19.\nStep2: '+' has priority over '*'. Now we calculate '+': 0.9294117647058824 + 19 = 19.929411764705883, so the expression becomes 7 * 19.929411764705883.\nStep3: Finally, 7 * 19.929411764705883 = 139.50588235294117, so this answer choice evaluates to 139.50588235294117.\n\nGiven above, only with choice C, the expression evaluates to 25.50588235294118, so the correct answer should be [C]\n\nFor the expression 22 + 39 / 79 * 3, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

We test four options one by one.\nFor A: The value of 75 - 2 * 1 / 27 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '/' > '*' > '-', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '*'. '-' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '/' has the highest priority, we calculate '/' first: 1 / 27 = 0.037037037037037035, so the expression becomes 75 - 2 * 0.037037037037037035.\nStep2: Since '*' has priority over '-', we then calculate '*': 2 * 0.037037037037037035 = 0.07407407407407407, so the expression becomes 75 - 0.07407407407407407.\nStep3: Finally, 75 - 0.07407407407407407 = 74.92592592592592, so this answer choice evaluates to 74.92592592592592.\n\nFor B: The value of 75 - 2 * 1 / 27 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '/' = '*' > '-', '/' and '*' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '-'\nStep1: Since '/' and '*' have the same priority over -, we evaluate '/' and '*' from left to right. In this case, '*' comes before '/', so we calculate '*' first: 2 * 1 = 2, so the expression becomes 75 - 2 / 27.\nStep2: '/' has priority over '-'. Now we calculate '/': 2 / 27 = 0.07407407407407407, so the expression becomes 75 - 0.07407407407407407.\nStep3: Finally, 75 - 0.07407407407407407 = 74.92592592592592, so this answer choice evaluates to 74.92592592592592.\n\nFor C: The value of 75 - 2 * 1 / 27 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '-' > '*' > '/', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '*'.

Please choose the correct answer from A, B, C, and D, and put the final answer choice in brackets, for example, [B].\nA. '-' = '/' > '*'\nB. '/' > '-' > '*'\nC. '*' > '/' > '-'\nD. '/' > '*' = '-'\n\n[Answer]: \nUsing the precedence rule in the correct answer choice, the expression 45 - 46 / 28 * 81 should evaluate to -2.892857142857143. We test four options one by one.\nFor A: The value of 45 - 46 / 28 * 81 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '-' = '/' > '*', '-' and '/' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '*'\nStep1: Since '-' and '/' have the same priority over *, we evaluate '-' and '/' from left to right. In this case, '-' comes before '/', so we calculate '-' first: 45 - 46 = -1, so the expression becomes -1 / 28 * 81.\nStep2: '/' has priority over '*'. Now we calculate '/': -1 / 28 = -0.03571428571428571, so the expression becomes -0.03571428571428571 * 81.\nStep3: Finally, -0.03571428571428571 * 81 = -2.892857142857143, so this answer choice evaluates to -2.892857142857143.\n\nFor B: The value of 45 - 46 / 28 * 81 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '/' > '-' > '*', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '-'. '*' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '/' has the highest priority, we calculate '/' first: 46 / 28 = 1.6428571428571428, so the expression becomes 45 - 1.6428571428571428 * 81.\nStep2: Since '-' has priority over '*', we then calculate '-': 45 - 1.6428571428571428 = 43.357142857142854, so the expression becomes 43.357142857142854 * 81.\nStep3: Finally, 43.357142857142854 * 81 = 3511.928571428571, so this answer choice evaluates to 3511.928571428571.\n\nFor C: The value of 45 - 46 / 28 * 81 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '*' > '/' > '-', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '/'. '-' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '*' has the highest priority, we calculate '*' first: 28 * 81 = 2268, so the expression becomes 45 - 46 / 2268.\nStep2: Since '/' has priority over '-', we then calculate '/': 46 / 2268 = 0.020282186948853614, so the expression becomes 45 - 0.020282186948853614.\nStep3: Finally, 45 - 0.020282186948853614 = 44.979717813051145, so this answer choice evaluates to 44.979717813051145.\n\nFor D: The value of 45 - 46 / 28 * 81 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '/' > '*' = '-', '/' has the highest priority, followed by '*' and '-', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '/' has the highest priority, we calculate '/' first: 46 / 28 = 1.6428571428571428, so the expression becomes 45 - 1.6428571428571428 * 81.\nStep2: Since '*' and '-' have the same priority. Now we evaluate the expression from left to right. 45 - 1.6428571428571428 = 43.357142857142854, so the expression becomes 43.357142857142854 * 81.\nStep3: Finally, 43.357142857142854 * 81 = 3511.928571428571, so this answer choice evaluates to 3511.928571428571.\n\nGiven above, only with choice A, the expression evaluates to -2.892857142857143, so the correct answer should be [A]\n\nFor the expression 13 * 13 - 12 / 78, the precedence of the operators is redefined.
