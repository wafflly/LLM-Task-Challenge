'+' > '*' = '-'\n\n[Answer]: \nUsing the precedence rule in the correct answer choice, the expression 157 + 367 * 831 - 969 should evaluate to 434475. We test four options one by one.\nFor A: The value of 157 + 367 * 831 - 969 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '-' > '*' = '+', '-' has the highest priority, followed by '*' and '+', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '-' has the highest priority, we calculate '-' first: 831 - 969 = -138, so the expression becomes 157 + 367 * -138.\nStep2: Since '*' and '+' have the same priority. Now we evaluate the expression from left to right. 157 + 367 = 524, so the expression becomes 524 * -138.\nStep3: Finally, 524 * -138 = -72312, so this answer choice evaluates to -72312.\n\nSimilarly, we evaluate the expressions in B, C, and D in the same way as we evaluate the expression in A.\nFor B: using the precedence rule of choice B: '*' > '-' > '+', the expression 157 + 367 * 831 - 969 evaluates to 304165\nFor C: using the precedence rule of choice C: '*' > '+' > '-', the expression 157 + 367 * 831 - 969 evaluates to 304165\nFor D: using the precedence rule of choice D: '+' > '*' = '-', the expression 157 + 367 * 831 - 969 evaluates to 434475\nGiven above, only with choice D, the expression evaluates to 434475, so the correct answer should be [D]\n\nFor the expression 39 + 134 * 388 - 841, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

We test four options one by one.\nFor A: The value of 380 * 640 - 326 / 121 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '-' > '*' > '/', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '*'. '/' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '-' has the highest priority, we calculate '-' first: 640 - 326 = 314, so the expression becomes 380 * 314 / 121.\nStep2: Since '*' has priority over '/', we then calculate '*': 380 * 314 = 119320, so the expression becomes 119320 / 121.\nStep3: Finally, 119320 / 121 = 986.1157024793389, so this answer choice evaluates to 986.1157024793389.\n\nSimilarly, we evaluate the expressions in B, C, and D in the same way as we evaluate the expression in A.\nFor B: using the precedence rule of choice B: '/' = '-' > '*', the expression 380 * 640 - 326 / 121 evaluates to 986.1157024793388\nFor C: using the precedence rule of choice C: '*' = '-' = '/', the expression 380 * 640 - 326 / 121 evaluates to 2007.2231404958677\nFor D: using the precedence rule of choice D: '-' > '/' = '*', the expression 380 * 640 - 326 / 121 evaluates to 986.1157024793389\nGiven above, only with choice C, the expression evaluates to 2007.2231404958677, so the correct answer should be [C]\n\nFor the expression 737 - 468 / 915 * 737, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

In this case, '/' comes before '-', so we calculate '/' first: 60 / 180 = 0.3333333333333333, so the expression becomes 642 * 0.3333333333333333 - 272.\nStep2: '-' has priority over '*'. Now we calculate '-': 0.3333333333333333 - 272 = -271.6666666666667, so the expression becomes 642 * -271.6666666666667.\nStep3: Finally, 642 * -271.6666666666667 = -174410.0, so this answer choice evaluates to -174410.0.\n\nSimilarly, we evaluate the expressions in B, C, and D in the same way as we evaluate the expression in A.\nFor B: using the precedence rule of choice B: '-' > '/' = '*', the expression 642 * 60 / 180 - 272 evaluates to -418.69565217391306\nFor C: using the precedence rule of choice C: '*' > '/' > '-', the expression 642 * 60 / 180 - 272 evaluates to -58.0\nFor D: using the precedence rule of choice D: '/' > '-' > '*', the expression 642 * 60 / 180 - 272 evaluates to -174410.0\nGiven above, only with choice C, the expression evaluates to -58.0, so the correct answer should be [C]\n\nFor the expression 860 * 870 - 853 / 265, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

'-' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '/' has the highest priority, we calculate '/' first: 974 / 829 = 1.174909529553679, so the expression becomes 807 * 250 - 1.174909529553679.\nStep2: Since '*' has priority over '-', we then calculate '*': 807 * 250 = 201750, so the expression becomes 201750 - 1.174909529553679.\nStep3: Finally, 201750 - 1.174909529553679 = 201748.82509047043, so this answer choice evaluates to 201748.82509047043.\n\nSimilarly, we evaluate the expressions in B, C, and D in the same way as we evaluate the expression in A.\nFor B: using the precedence rule of choice B: '/' > '*' = '-', the expression 807 * 250 - 974 / 829 evaluates to 201748.82509047043\nFor C: using the precedence rule of choice C: '*' = '-' = '/', the expression 807 * 250 - 974 / 829 evaluates to 242.19059107358262\nFor D: using the precedence rule of choice D: '/' = '*' > '-', the expression 807 * 250 - 974 / 829 evaluates to 201748.82509047043\nGiven above, only with choice C, the expression evaluates to 242.19059107358262, so the correct answer should be [C]\n\nFor the expression 712 * 925 - 762 / 586, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

In this case, '/' comes before '-', so we calculate '/' first: 139 / 280 = 0.49642857142857144, so the expression becomes 0.49642857142857144 * 352 - 895.\nStep2: '-' has priority over '*'.
