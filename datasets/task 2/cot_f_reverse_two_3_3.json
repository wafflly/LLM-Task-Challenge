'*' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '-' has the highest priority, we calculate '-' first: 389 - 56 = 333, so the expression becomes 328 * 120 / 333.\nStep2: Since '/' has priority over '*', we then calculate '/': 120 / 333 = 0.36036036036036034, so the expression becomes 328 * 0.36036036036036034.\nStep3: Finally, 328 * 0.36036036036036034 = 118.1981981981982, so this answer choice evaluates to 118.1981981981982.\n\nFor B: The value of 328 * 120 / 389 - 56 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '*' = '-' > '/', '*' and '-' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '/'\nStep1: Since '*' and '-' have the same priority over /, we evaluate '*' and '-' from left to right. In this case, '*' comes before '-', so we calculate '*' first: 328 * 120 = 39360, so the expression becomes 39360 / 389 - 56.\nStep2: '-' has priority over '/'. Now we calculate '-': 389 - 56 = 333, so the expression becomes 39360 / 333.\nStep3: Finally, 39360 / 333 = 118.1981981981982, so this answer choice evaluates to 118.1981981981982.\n\nFor C: The value of 328 * 120 / 389 - 56 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '*' = '/' > '-', '*' and '/' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '-'\nStep1: Since '*' and '/' have the same priority over -, we evaluate '*' and '/' from left to right. In this case, '*' comes before '/', so we calculate '*' first: 328 * 120 = 39360, so the expression becomes 39360 / 389 - 56.\nStep2: '/' has priority over '-'. Now we calculate '/': 39360 / 389 = 101.18251928020565, so the expression becomes 101.18251928020565 - 56.\nStep3: Finally, 101.18251928020565 - 56 = 45.18251928020565, so this answer choice evaluates to 45.18251928020565.\n\nFor D: The value of 328 * 120 / 389 - 56 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '-' = '/' > '*', '-' and '/' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '*'\nStep1: Since '-' and '/' have the same priority over *, we evaluate '-' and '/' from left to right. In this case, '/' comes before '-', so we calculate '/' first: 120 / 389 = 0.30848329048843187, so the expression becomes 328 * 0.30848329048843187 - 56.\nStep2: '-' has priority over '*'. Now we calculate '-': 0.30848329048843187 - 56 = -55.69151670951157, so the expression becomes 328 * -55.69151670951157.\nStep3: Finally, 328 * -55.69151670951157 = -18266.817480719794, so this answer choice evaluates to -18266.817480719794.\n\nGiven above, only with choice C, the expression evaluates to 45.18251928020565, so the correct answer should be [C]\n\nFor the expression 334 / 966 * 901 - 333, the precedence of the operators is redefined.
