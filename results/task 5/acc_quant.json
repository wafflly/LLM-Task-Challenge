Sentence 4 states that wolves are afraid of sheep, which is not relevant to Emily's fears. Sentence 5 states that some mice are afraid of some wolves. Since Emily is a mouse, it is possible that she could be one of the mice that are afraid of wolves. There is no information provided about mice being afraid of other mice or sheep.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer based on the information given is that Emily could be afraid of wolves.\n\nThe correct answer is [C] (5, 6).",
