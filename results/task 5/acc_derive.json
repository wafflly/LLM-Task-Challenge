Therefore, Gertrude, being a wolf, would be afraid of Emily, Jessica, and Winona, who are all mice. The question asks what Gertrude is afraid of, and since Emily and Jessica are both mentioned as options and both are mice, Gertrude would be afraid of either of them.\n\nThe correct answer is [B] for Emily or [D] for Jessica, but since the question only allows for one answer and both are equally correct, we can say that there is not enough information provided to determine which specific mouse Gertrude is afraid of between Emily and Jessica. However, since the question does not ask for a specific mouse but rather what Gertrude is afraid of in general, and we know she is afraid of mice, we can conclude that Gertrude is afraid of mice, which includes both Emily and Jessica.\n\nFinal answer: [B] or [D] (5, 3, 4, 7).",
