We are given two sentences in English and their corresponding translations in Language A:\n\n1. English: The attentive mother in the peaceful park watches the child closely for safety.\n   Language A: tgt_in tgt_the tgt_peaceful tgt_park tgt_the tgt_attentive tgt_mother tgt_the tgt_child tgt_watches tgt_closely tgt_for tgt_safety.\n\n2.

This indicates that the determiner \"the\" and the adjective \"attentive/efficient\" precede the noun \"mother/accountant\" in Language A, just as they do in English.\n\n- The verb phrases \"watches the child closely for safety\" and \"calculates the annual budget accurately with software\" are translated as \"tgt_the tgt_child tgt_watches tgt_closely tgt_for tgt_safety\" and \"tgt_calculates tgt_the tgt_annual tgt_budget tgt_accurately tgt_with tgt_software,\" respectively. This indicates that the verb \"watches/calculates\" follows the object \"the child/the annual budget\" in Language A.\n\n- The prepositional phrases \"in the peaceful park\" and \"at the firm\" are translated as \"tgt_in tgt_the tgt_peaceful tgt_park\" and \"tgt_at tgt_the tgt_firm,\" respectively, which suggests that prepositions in Language A precede their objects, similar to English.\n\nGiven these observations, we can deduce that the subject comes before the object and the object comes before the verb in Language A. This suggests an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) word order. The verb is placed at the end of the sentence, after the object. Therefore, the correct syntactic characteristic of Language A is:\n\nC. Language A follows only SOV word order [C]."

English: The young lady with dyed hair cooks potatoes slowly with passion.\n   Language A: tgt_with tgt_dyed tgt_hair tgt_the tgt_young tgt_lady tgt_cooks tgt_potatoes tgt_slowly tgt_with tgt_passion\n\nFrom these translations, we can observe the following:\n\n- The subject in both sentences comes before the verb. In the first sentence, \"tgt_the tgt_young tgt_man\" precedes \"tgt_builds,\" and in the second sentence, \"tgt_the tgt_young tgt_lady\" precedes \"tgt_cooks.\"\n- The object in both sentences comes after the verb. In the first sentence, \"tgt_his tgt_house\" follows \"tgt_builds,\" and in the second sentence, \"tgt_potatoes\" follows \"tgt_cooks.\"\n\nThis suggests that the canonical word order of Language A is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). However, we need to be cautious and not infer the canonical word order based on the order between nouns and their modifiers, as instructed.\n\nGiven that we are not to infer from the order of modifiers and that we can assume the same syntactic structures with the exception of word order variations between children of a node, we can conclude that the consistent pattern of Subject-Verb-Object in the given sentences indicates that Language A follows an SVO word order.\n\nTherefore, the correct syntactic characteristic of Language A, based on the information provided, is:\n\nB.

However, we cannot conclusively determine that Language A follows only SOV word order because we do not have enough information about sentences where the object comes after the verb. We need to see more examples to rule out the possibility of SVO word order.\n\nBased on the information given and the instructions not to infer from other components or universal implicatures, we can only say that Language A follows either SVO or SOV word order, as we have seen the subject come before the verb in both sentences, but we do not have enough evidence to rule out SVO entirely.\n\nFinal answer: [D] Language A follows either SVO or SOV word order."

However, the second sentence does not provide a clear SOV structure since the verb does not come at the end. The instructions warn against using universal implicatures for inference, which means we should not assume that the placement of the verb in the second sentence necessarily indicates a deviation from the SOV order.\n\nSince we are to assume that the syntactic structures are the same except for the word order variation between children of a node, and we have a clear SOV structure in the first sentence, we can tentatively conclude that Language A follows an SOV word order, but with the possibility of some flexibility in the placement of the verb when it comes to prepositional phrases or other sentence modifiers.\n\nTherefore, the correct syntactic characteristic of Language A, based on the information provided, is:\n\nC.
