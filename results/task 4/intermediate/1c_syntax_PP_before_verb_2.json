In Language A, these phrases are translated as \"tgt_in tgt_the tgt_workshop\" and \"tgt_with tgt_his tgt_strong tgt_hands.\" The placement of these phrases in relation to the verb \"builds\" (translated as \"tgt_builds\") is as follows:\n\n- \"tgt_in tgt_the tgt_workshop\" appears before the noun it modifies, not the verb.\n- \"tgt_with tgt_his tgt_strong tgt_hands\" appears before \"tgt_builds.\"\n\nIn the second English sentence, \"The thoughtful friend with a warm heart gives the heartfelt gift generously on the special occasion,\" the prepositional phrases are \"with a warm heart\" and \"on the special occasion.\" These phrases modify the noun \"friend\" and the verb \"gives,\" respectively.

The translation in Language A is 'tgt_with tgt_a tgt_small tgt_tail tgt_the tgt_yellow tgt_dog tgt_chases tgt_the tgt_cat tgt_happily tgt_on tgt_the tgt_street'. Here, the prepositional phrase 'tgt_on tgt_the tgt_street' appears after the verb 'tgt_chases'.\n\nFrom these examples, we can see that the prepositional phrase can appear either before ('with its tranquil surface' before 'reflects') or after ('on the street' after 'chases') the verb it modifies in Language A. This indicates that Language A allows for variability in the placement of prepositional phrases in relation to the verbs they modify.\n\nTherefore, the correct syntactic characteristic of Language A is:\n\nB.

      "content": "Based on the provided translations, we can analyze the placement of prepositional phrases in relation to the verbs they modify in Language A.\n\nIn the first English sentence, \"welcomed\" is modified by \"with a warm heart,\" and in Language A, this becomes \"tgt_welcomed tgt_with tgt_a tgt_warm tgt_heart.\" Here, the prepositional phrase \"with a warm heart\" follows the verb \"welcomed.\"\n\nIn the second English sentence, \"wins\" is modified by \"on the track,\" and in Language A, this becomes \"tgt_wins tgt_on tgt_the tgt_track.\" Similarly, the prepositional phrase \"on the track\" follows the verb \"wins.\"\n\nFrom these examples, we can observe that the prepositional phrases that modify the verbs in Language A consistently appear after the verbs they modify. There are no instances provided where a prepositional phrase modifying a verb appears before the verb. Therefore, based on the given information, we can conclude that:\n\nB. Prepositional phrase appears only after the modified verb\n\nFinal answer: [B]"
