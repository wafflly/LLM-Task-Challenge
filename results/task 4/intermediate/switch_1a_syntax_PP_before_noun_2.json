Do not infer the placement of prepositional phrases in relation to the noun they modify based on word order of other components in the sentences such as the order between verbs and their modifiers; for instance, do not use universal implicatures for inference. You can assume that each pair of sentences has the same syntactic structures, with the exception that word order may vary between children of a node in the syntactic structures.
