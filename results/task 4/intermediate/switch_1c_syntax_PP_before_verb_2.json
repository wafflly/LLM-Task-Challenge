      "content": "Based on the given translations, we can observe the following placements of prepositional phrases in relation to the verbs they modify:\n\nIn the first sentence:\n- The prepositional phrase \"with soft fur\" modifies \"cat\" and is not relevant to the placement in relation to the verb.\n- The prepositional phrase \"with a jump\" modifies the verb \"catches\" and appears after the verb in Language A: \"tgt_catches tgt_the tgt_red tgt_ball tgt_easily tgt_with tgt_a tgt_jump.\"\n\nIn the second sentence:\n- The prepositional phrase \"in the smoky room\" modifies \"firefighter\" and is not relevant to the placement in relation to the verb.\n- The prepositional phrase \"without hesitation\" modifies the verb \"rescues\" and appears before the verb in Language A: \"tgt_without tgt_hesitation tgt_quickly tgt_rescues tgt_the tgt_cat.\"\n\nFrom these observations, we can see that the prepositional phrase modifying the verb \"catches\" appears after the verb, while the prepositional phrase modifying the verb \"rescues\" appears before the verb. This indicates that prepositional phrases in Language A can appear either before or after the verb they modify.\n\nTherefore, the correct syntactic characteristic of Language A is:\n\nD.

Your answer should be based solely on the placement of prepositional phrases in relation to the verb they modify in the given sentence pairs. Do not infer the placement of prepositional phrases in relation to the verb they modify based on word order of other components in the sentences such as the order between nouns and their modifiers; for instance, do not use universal implicatures for inference. You can assume that each pair of sentences has the same syntactic structures, with the exception that word order may vary between children of a node in the syntactic structures. This means there are no translation divergences that alter the syntactic structure. Given this context, please determine the correct syntactic characteristic of Language A:\n\nA. Prepositional phrase can appear either before or after the modified verb\nB. Prepositional phrase appears only after the modified verb\nC. Prepositional phrase appears only before the modified verb\nD.

      "content": "Based on the provided translations and the instructions to focus solely on the placement of prepositional phrases in relation to the verb they modify, we can analyze the two sentences:\n\n1. In the first English sentence, \"wins\" is modified by the prepositional phrase \"on the track.\" In Language A, this is translated to \"tgt_wins tgt_swiftly tgt_on tgt_the tgt_track.\" Here, the prepositional phrase \"tgt_on tgt_the tgt_track\" follows the verb \"tgt_wins.\"\n\n2. In the second English sentence, \"welcomed\" is modified by the prepositional phrase \"with a warm heart.\" In Language A, this is translated to \"tgt_a tgt_lady tgt_in tgt_a tgt_green tgt_dress tgt_her tgt_distinguished tgt_guests tgt_with tgt_a tgt_warm tgt_heart tgt_kindly tgt_welcomed.\" Here, the prepositional phrase \"tgt_with tgt_a tgt_warm tgt_heart\" follows the verb \"tgt_welcomed.\"\n\nIn both cases, the prepositional phrases that modify the verbs appear after the verbs in Language A. There is no evidence from the given sentences that prepositional phrases ever appear before the verbs they modify in Language A. Therefore, based on the given data, we can conclude that:\n\nB. Prepositional phrase appears only after the modified verb [B]."
