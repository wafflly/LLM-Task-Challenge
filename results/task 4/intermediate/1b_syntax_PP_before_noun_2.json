      "content": "Based on the information provided, we can analyze the placement of prepositional phrases in relation to the noun they modify in Language A by looking at the given translations.\n\nIn the first sentence, the prepositional phrase \"in the thick smoke\" modifies the noun \"firefighter,\" and in Language A, it is translated as \"tgt_in tgt_the tgt_thick tgt_smoke tgt_the tgt_firefighter.\" Here, the prepositional phrase appears before the noun it modifies.\n\nIn the second sentence, the prepositional phrase \"with a wagging tail\" modifies the noun \"dog,\" and in Language A, it is translated as \"tgt_the tgt_loyal tgt_dog tgt_with tgt_a tgt_wagging tgt_tail.\" Again, the prepositional phrase appears before the noun it modifies.\n\nFrom these examples, we can observe that the prepositional phrases in Language A appear before the noun they modify. There is no evidence from the given sentences that prepositional phrases in Language A ever appear after the noun they modify. Therefore, based on the provided translations and the instructions not to infer from other components of the sentences, we can conclude that:\n\nC. Prepositional phrase appears only before the modified noun [C]."
