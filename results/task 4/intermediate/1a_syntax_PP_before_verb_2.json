      "content": "Based on the provided translations and the instructions to focus solely on the placement of prepositional phrases in relation to the verb they modify, we can observe the following patterns:\n\nIn the first sentence:\n- The prepositional phrase \"at the castle\" in English corresponds to \"tgt_at tgt_the tgt_castle\" in Language A.\n- The prepositional phrase \"to the tourists\" in English corresponds to \"tgt_to tgt_the tgt_tourists\" in Language A.\n- The verb \"explains\" in English corresponds to \"tgt_explains\" in Language A.\n\nThe translation shows that \"tgt_at tgt_the tgt_castle\" comes before \"tgt_explains\" and \"tgt_to tgt_the tgt_tourists\" comes before \"tgt_explains\" as well.\n\nIn the second sentence:\n- The prepositional phrase \"with a gentle voice\" in English corresponds to \"tgt_with tgt_a tgt_gentle tgt_voice\" in Language A.\n- The prepositional phrase \"to the class\" in English corresponds to \"tgt_to tgt_the tgt_class\" in Language A.\n- The verb \"explains\" in English corresponds to \"tgt_explains\" in Language A.\n\nAgain, the translation shows that \"tgt_with tgt_a tgt_gentle tgt_voice\" comes before \"tgt_explains\" and \"tgt_to tgt_the tgt_class\" comes before \"tgt_explains\".\n\nFrom these observations, we can conclude that in Language A, the prepositional phrases that modify the verb appear before the verb they modify. There is no evidence in the given sentences that prepositional phrases appear after the verb they modify in Language A.\n\nTherefore, the correct syntactic characteristic of Language A is:\n\nA. Prepositional phrase appears only before the modified verb [A]."
