      "content": "Based on the provided translations, we can observe the following placements of prepositional phrases in relation to the verbs they modify in Language A:\n\nIn the first sentence:\n- The prepositional phrase \"with a warm heart\" modifies the verb \"welcomed\" and appears before the verb in Language A: \"tgt_with tgt_a tgt_warm tgt_heart tgt_kindly tgt_welcomed\".\n\nIn the second sentence:\n- The prepositional phrase \"on the track\" modifies the verb \"wins\" and appears before the verb in Language A: \"tgt_the tgt_challenging tgt_race tgt_on tgt_the tgt_track tgt_swiftly tgt_wins\".\n\nFrom these observations, we can see that in both sentences, the prepositional phrases that modify the verbs appear before the verbs they modify in Language A. There is no evidence from the given sentences that prepositional phrases appear after the verbs they modify. Therefore, the correct syntactic characteristic of Language A, based on the information provided, is:\n\nA. Prepositional phrase appears only before the modified verb [A]."
