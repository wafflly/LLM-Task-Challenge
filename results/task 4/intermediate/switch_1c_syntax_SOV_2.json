However, we do not have enough information to definitively determine whether Language A consistently follows SVO or SOV word order because the object appears before the verb in the second sentence and after the verb in the first sentence.

This discrepancy suggests that the canonical word order of Language A is not strictly SVO, as the object precedes the verb in the second sentence.\n\nGiven that we cannot infer the canonical word order based on the order between nouns and their modifiers and that we must not assume translation divergences that alter the syntactic structure, we are left with an inconsistency between the two sentences. The first sentence suggests SVO order, while the second suggests SOV order.\n\nSince we have evidence of both SVO and SOV structures and we are instructed not to infer word order based on other components or universal implicatures, the correct answer is that Language A follows either SVO or SOV word order.\n\nFinal answer: [C]."

This is consistent in both translated sentences, where \"tgt_gardener\" (subject) comes before \"tgt_trims\" (verb), and \"tgt_trims\" comes before \"tgt_bush\" (object) in the first sentence, and \"tgt_player\" (subject) comes before \"tgt_throws\" (verb), and \"tgt_throws\" comes before \"tgt_ball\" (object) in the second sentence.\n\nTherefore, the correct syntactic characteristic of Language A is:\n\nB.

However, since we are told not to infer the canonical word order based on the order between nouns and their modifiers and to assume that each pair of sentences has the same syntactic structures, we should focus on the position of the subject, verb, and object as a whole.\n\nGiven that the subject and object are noun phrases that include prepositional phrases as modifiers, and we are not to infer based on the order of these modifiers, we should look at the core elements: tgt_the tgt_professional tgt_driver (subject) and tgt_the tgt_busy tgt_street (object). The verb tgt_navigates comes after both the subject and object noun phrases, which suggests an SOV structure for this sentence.\n\nHowever, we have conflicting information: the first sentence suggests SVO, while the second suggests SOV. Since we are instructed that there are no translation divergences that alter the syntactic structure, we must assume that the apparent OVS structure in the second sentence is due to the inclusion of modifiers within the noun phrases and not indicative of the canonical word order.\n\nGiven this, we cannot conclusively determine whether Language A follows only SVO or only SOV word order based on the provided sentences. Therefore, the correct answer is that Language A follows either SVO or SOV word order, depending on the sentence structure and the placement of modifiers within the noun phrases.\n\nFinal answer: [B]."

Do not infer the canonical word order based on word order of other components in the sentences such as the order between nouns and their modifiers; for instance, do not use universal implicatures for inference. You can assume that each pair of sentences has the same syntactic structures, with the exception that word order may vary between children of a node in the syntactic structures. This means there are no translation divergences that alter the syntactic structure. Given this context, please determine the correct syntactic characteristic of Language A:\n\nA.

In the first sentence, the verb follows the subject, while in the second sentence, the verb comes after the object. This indicates that Language A does not strictly follow SVO or SOV word order. Instead, it seems that Language A allows for both SVO and SOV structures, depending on the sentence.\n\nTherefore, the correct syntactic characteristic of Language A is:\n\nD. Language A follows either SVO or SOV word order [D]."
