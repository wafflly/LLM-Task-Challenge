                    "[Example Question]: What is the value of 95 * 17 - 89 / 30? \n[Answer]: Based on the elementary arithmetic, '*' and '/' have the same priority. They have higher priority over '+' and '-', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '*' and '/' have the same priority over '-', we evaluate them from left to right. In this case, '*' comes before '/', so we calculate '*' first: 95 * 17 = 1615, so the expression becomes 1615 - 89 / 30.\nStep2: Since '/' has priority over '-', we then calculate '/': 89 / 30 = 2.966666666666667, so the expression becomes 1615 - 2.966666666666667.\nStep3: Finally, 1615 - 2.966666666666667 = 1612.0333333333333, so the final answer is [1612.0333333333333].\n\nWhat is the value of 13 * 13 - 12 / 78?

They have higher priority over '+' and '-', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '/' has priority over '+' and '-', we evaluate '/' first: 90 / 61 = 1.4754098360655739, so the expression becomes 13 - 14 + 1.4754098360655739.\nStep2: Since '+' and '-' have the same priority, we evaluate them from left to right.
