We evaluate '*' before '-' because '*' comes before '-' in the expression. So we calculate 70 * 95 first:\n\n70 * 95 = 6650\n\nNow the expression becomes 97 / 6650 - 57.\n\nStep 2: Next, we evaluate '-', since it has a higher priority than '/'. However, we cannot directly subtract 57 from 6650 because 6650 is currently part of a division operation with 97. We need to evaluate the division first to determine what we are subtracting 57 from. So we calculate 97 / 6650:\n\n97 / 6650 ≈ 0.014586466165413534\n\nNow the expression becomes 0.014586466165413534 - 57.\n\nStep 3: Finally, we subtract 57 from the result of the division:\n\n0.014586466165413534 - 57 ≈ -56.985413533834586\n\nSo the final answer is [-56.985413533834586]."
