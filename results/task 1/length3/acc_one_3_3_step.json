Normally, multiplication has higher precedence than addition and subtraction, but in this case, addition and multiplication have the same precedence and should be evaluated from left to right before subtraction.\n\nLet's evaluate the expression 247 - 716 + 685 * 707 step by step:\n\n1. First, we perform the addition and multiplication from left to right, as they have the same priority.\n2. Since addition comes before subtraction in the expression, we do that first:\n\n247 - 716 + 685 = -469 + 685\n\n3. Now we perform the multiplication:\n\n685 * 707 = 484235\n\n4.
