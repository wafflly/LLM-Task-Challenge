Lastly, we perform the multiplication '*'.\n\nLet's calculate it step by step:\n\n1. Addition (+):\n   Since there are no parentheses to alter the order, we start with the addition of 2 and 60:\n   2 + 60 = 62\n\n2. Division (/):\n   Now we perform the division with the result from the addition and the first number in the expression:\n   1 / 62\n\n3. Multiplication (*):\n   Finally, we multiply the result of the division by 55:\n   (1 / 62) * 55\n\nNow let's calculate the numerical values:\n\n1 / 62 = 0.016129032258064516 (approximately)\n0.016129032258064516 * 55 = 0.8870967741935484 (approximately)\n\nSo the final result of the expression 1 / 2 + 60 * 55 with the new operator priorities is approximately [0.8870967741935484]."
