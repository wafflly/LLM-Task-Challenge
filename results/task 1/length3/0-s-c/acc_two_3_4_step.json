Perform the subtraction first (since '-' has the highest priority):\n   2835 - 6535 = -3700\n\n2. Now we have the expression:\n   2224 / 7599 * (-3700)\n\n3. Next, perform the multiplication (since '*' has the next highest priority):\n   2224 * (-3700) = -8228800\n\n4. Finally, perform the division (since '/' has the lowest priority):\n   -8228800 / 7599 ≈ -1082.75694\n\nSo the value of the expression 2224 / 7599 * 2835 - 6535, based on the new priorities, is approximately [-1082.75694]."
