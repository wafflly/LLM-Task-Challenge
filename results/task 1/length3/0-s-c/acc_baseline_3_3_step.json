                    "To solve the expression 712 * 925 - 762 / 586 step by step, we should follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\nFirst, we perform the multiplication and division before the subtraction:\n\n1. Multiply 712 by 925:\n712 * 925 = 658600\n\n2. Divide 762 by 586:\n762 / 586 ≈ 1.30034129692833 (rounded to 14 decimal places for precision in this step)\n\nNow we have the expression:\n658600 - 1.30034129692833\n\n3. Subtract the result of the division from the result of the multiplication:\n658600 - 1.30034129692833 ≈ 658598.699658703 (rounded to 12 decimal places for precision in this step)\n\nSo the final result is approximately [658598.70] when rounded to two decimal places."
