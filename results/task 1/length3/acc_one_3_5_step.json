So, we'll just keep the division result handy and move on to the multiplication.\n\nStep 3: Perform the multiplication (71270 * 90735)\n71270 * 90735 = 6467529450\n\nNow we can perform the subtraction with the result from the division:\n\nStep 4: Subtract the division result from the multiplication result\n6467529450 - 0.534285... ≈ 6467529450 - 0.5343 (rounded to four decimal places)\n\nThe subtraction will not significantly affect the whole number part of the multiplication result since we are subtracting a number that is less than 1. Therefore, the result will still be very close to the whole number we obtained from the multiplication:\n\n6467529450 - 0.5343 ≈ 6467529449.4657\n\nRounded to the nearest whole number, the result is approximately 6467529449.\n\nSo the value of the expression 71270 * 90735 - 44516 / 83318 with the new operator priorities is approximately [6467529449]."
