Perform the first operation (19 - 21):\n   19 - 21 = -2\n\n2. Add the result to the next number (98):\n   -2 + 98 = 96\n\n3.

According to these new rules, we should perform the multiplication before the division and subtraction, and since division and subtraction have equal priority, we should evaluate them from left to right.\n\nLet's evaluate the expression step by step:\n\n1. Perform the multiplication (since '*' has the highest priority):\n   45 * 54 = 2430\n\n   So the expression becomes:\n   55 - 2430 / 9\n\n2. Perform the division (since '/' and '-' have equal priority, we proceed from left to right):\n   2430 / 9 = 270\n\n   So the expression becomes:\n   55 - 270\n\n3.
