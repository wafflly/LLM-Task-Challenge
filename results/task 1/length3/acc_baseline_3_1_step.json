The expression you've given is:\n\n1 / 1 * 5 - 1\n\nSince there are no parentheses or exponents, we'll start with multiplication and division from left to right.\n\nFirst, we divide 1 by 1:\n1 / 1 = 1\n\nNow we multiply the result by 5:\n1 * 5 = 5\n\nFinally, we subtract 1 from the result:\n5 - 1 = 4\n\nSo the final result of the expression 1 / 1 * 5 - 1 is [4]."
