'-' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '*' has the highest priority, we calculate '*' first: 6325 * 7642 = 48335650, so the expression becomes 1953 / 48335650 - 3873.\nStep2: Since '/' has priority over '-', we then calculate '/': 1953 / 48335650 = 4.040495990019789e-05, so the expression becomes 4.040495990019789e-05 - 3873.\nStep3: Finally, 4.040495990019789e-05 - 3873 = -3872.9999595950403, so the final answer is [-3872.9999595950403].\n\nBased on the new priorities, what is the value of 2224 / 7599 * 2835 - 6535?
