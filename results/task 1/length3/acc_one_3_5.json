Therefore, we must perform the division first, then the multiplication, and finally the subtraction. Let's calculate step by step:\n\n1. Division:\n49394 / 6769\n\nTo find the result of this division, we perform the operation:\n\n49394 / 6769 ≈ 7.297 (rounded to three decimal places)\n\n2. Multiplication:\nNow we multiply the result of the division by 25743:\n\n7.297 * 25743 ≈ 187785.831 (rounded to three decimal places)\n\n3. Subtraction:\nFinally, we subtract the result of the multiplication from 80330:\n\n80330 - 187785.831 ≈ -107455.831 (rounded to three decimal places)\n\nSo the final result of the expression 80330 - 49394 / 6769 * 25743, with the given priorities, is approximately [-107455.831]."
