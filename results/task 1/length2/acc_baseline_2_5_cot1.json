                "[Example Question]: What is the value of 19168 / 55465 * 63841? \n[Answer]: Based on the elementary arithmetic, '*' and '/' have the same priority. They have higher priority over '+' and '-', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '*' and '/' have the same priority, we evaluate them from left to right. In this case, '/' comes before '*', so we calculate '/' first: 19168 / 55465 = 0.3455873073109168, so the expression becomes 0.3455873073109168 * 63841.\nStep2: Next, 0.3455873073109168 * 63841 = 22062.63928603624, so the final answer is [22062.63928603624].\n\nWhat is the value of 71594 / 88079 * 63393?
