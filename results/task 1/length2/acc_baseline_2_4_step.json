However, for the sake of this calculation, we can simplify the expression by dividing both numbers by 5, which is a common divisor (not necessarily the greatest).\n\n3535 ÷ 5 = 707\n7190 ÷ 5 = 1438\n\nNow the expression looks like this: 707 / 1438 * 1595\n\nStep 2: Before multiplying by 1595, let's check if 707 and 1438 have any common factors to simplify further. Since 707 is a prime number, it does not have any common factors with 1438 other than 1. Therefore, we cannot simplify the fraction any further.\n\nStep 3: Now we can multiply the simplified fraction by 1595:\n\n707 / 1438 * 1595\n\nStep 4: To make the calculation easier, we can first multiply 707 by 1595 and then divide the result by 1438.\n\n707 * 1595 = 1127365\n\nStep 5: Now, divide 1127365 by 1438:\n\n1127365 / 1438 ≈ 784.25\n\nSo the final result of the expression 3535 / 7190 * 1595 is approximately [784.25]."
