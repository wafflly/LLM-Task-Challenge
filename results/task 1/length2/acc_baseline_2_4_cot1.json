They have higher priority over '+' and '-', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '/' has priority over '+', we calculate '/' first: 5837 / 9477 = 0.6159122085048011, so the expression becomes 362 + 0.6159122085048011.\nNext, 362 + 0.6159122085048011 = 362.6159122085048, so the final answer is [362.6159122085048].\n\nWhat is the value of 3323 + 8538 / 1541?
