                "To solve \\( \\frac{5}{8} + 4 \\), we first need to express the whole number 4 as a fraction with the same denominator as \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\). The equivalent fraction for 4 with a denominator of 8 is \\( \\frac{32}{8} \\) because \\( 4 \\times 8 = 32 \\).\n\nNow we can add the two fractions:\n\n\\( \\frac{5}{8} + \\frac{32}{8} = \\frac{5 + 32}{8} = \\frac{37}{8} \\)\n\nTo convert the improper fraction \\( \\frac{37}{8} \\) to a decimal, we divide 37 by 8:\n\n\\( 37 ÷ 8 = 4.625 \\)\n\nSo, the value of \\( \\frac{5}{8} + 4 \\) is \\( \\frac{37}{8} \\) as a fraction or 4.625 as a decimal.\n\nThe final numeric result in brackets is [4.625]."
