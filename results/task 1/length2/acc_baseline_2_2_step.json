To make the division easier, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1 in this case since 38 is a prime number and does not divide 77 evenly. So, we leave the fraction as is: \\( \\frac{77}{38} \\)\n\n3. Now, we perform the division as is: \\( \\frac{77}{38} = 2.02631578947... \\) (This is an approximation; the decimal is repeating.)\n\n4. Next, we multiply the result by 6: \\( 2.02631578947... \\times 6 \\)\n\n5. Performing the multiplication gives us: \\( 2.02631578947... \\times 6 \\approx 12.1578947368 \\)\n\n6. Rounding to a reasonable number of decimal places, we get approximately 12.16.\n\nSo, the final result is approximately [12.16]."
