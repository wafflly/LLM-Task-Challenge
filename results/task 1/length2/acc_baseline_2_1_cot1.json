                "[Example Question]: What is the value of 3 / 8 + 9? \n[Answer]: Based on the elementary arithmetic, '*' and '/' have the same priority. They have higher priority over '+' and '-', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '/' has priority over '+', we calculate '/' first: 3 / 8 = 0.375, so the expression becomes 0.375 + 9.\nNext, 0.375 + 9 = 9.375, so the final answer is [9.375].\n\nWhat is the value of 5 / 8 + 4? You can give the result as a decimal, and please put the final numeric result in brackets [], for example, [1].",
