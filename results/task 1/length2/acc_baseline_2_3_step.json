Subtract 368 from 413:\n   To do this, you can line up the numbers vertically and subtract each column, starting from the rightmost digit:\n   \n       413\n     - 368\n     ______\n   \n   Subtract the units place: 3 - 8.

Now we have the result of the first operation, which is 45. Next, we add this to 370:\n   45 + 370\n\n4.
