Therefore, X1 is connected to X4 as well.\n\nFrom statement 2 (X2 nyNar X3), we know that X2 shares the year of birth with X3, but this statement does not directly involve X1.\n\nCombining the information, we see that X1 shares the year of birth with both X2 and X4.

From the statements, we can see that X1 was born in 1990 along with X2 (from statement 3) and X4 (from statement 1). There is no direct statement linking X1 and X3, but since X2 and X3 are linked by their birth year (from statement 2), and X1 is linked to X2, it follows that X1 is also linked to X3 by the transitive property.\n\nTherefore, X1 zhCZrx X2, X3, and X4.

X1 dzgH X2 (3) means X1 and X2 were born in 1990.\n\nFrom statements (2) and (3), we can see that X1 was born in 1990 with both X4 and X2. There is no direct statement about X1 and X3, but from statement (1), we know that X2 and X3 were born in 1990. Since X1 was born in 1990 with X2 (from statement 3), and X2 was born in 1990 with X3 (from statement 1), it follows that X1, X2, and X3 share the same birth year of 1990.\n\nTherefore, X1 dzgH (was born in 1990 with) both X2 and X3. The correct answer is:\n\n[D] (1, 2, 3)",
