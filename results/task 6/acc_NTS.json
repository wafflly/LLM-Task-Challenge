X4 xcQE X1\n\nIf 'X xcQE Y' means 'X and Y are partially related', then we can analyze the relationships as follows:\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that X1 is partially related to X2.\nFrom statement 3, we know that X4 is partially related to X1.\n\nThere is no direct statement linking X1 to X3, but since X1 is related to X2 and X2 is related to X3 (from statement 2), one might think there is an indirect relationship between X1 and X3. However, the statements only establish a direct partial relationship and do not imply transitivity (i.e., the property that if X is related to Y and Y is related to Z, then X is related to Z). Therefore, we cannot assume that X1 is related to X3 based on the given information.\n\nThus, X1 is partially related to X2 and X4. The correct answer is:\n\n[E] (1, 3)",
