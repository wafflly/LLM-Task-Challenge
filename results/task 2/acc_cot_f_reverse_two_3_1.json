Therefore, the '+' operation cannot be happening first.\n\nLet's consider that '/' is happening first, and the result is then being multiplied by a small fraction:\n(8 / something) * 6 = 0.12698412698412698\n\nTo find the \"something,\" we can rearrange the equation:\n8 / something = 0.12698412698412698 / 6\n8 / something = 0.021164021164021163\n\nNow, we solve for \"something\":\nsomething = 8 / 0.021164021164021163\nsomething = 378\n\nThis suggests that the '+' operation is actually a subtraction in disguise, and the expression might be:\n8 / (9 * 6 - 9) = 0.12698412698412698\n\nLet's check:\n8 / (9 * 6 - 9) = 8 / (54 - 9)\n8 / 45 = 0.17777777777777778 (which is not the result we want)\n\nThis means that our assumption about the '+' being a subtraction is incorrect.

'*' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '/' has the highest priority, we calculate '/' first: 5 / 4 = 1.25, so the expression becomes 3 + 1.25 * 3.\nStep2: Since '+' has priority over '*', we then calculate '+': 3 + 1.25 = 4.25, so the expression becomes 4.25 * 3.\nStep3: Finally, 4.25 * 3 = 12.75, so this answer choice evaluates to 12.75.\n\nFor C: The value of 3 + 5 / 4 * 3 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '+' = '/' = '*', +, /, and * have the same priority,so we can evaluate the expression from left to right\nStep1: Firstly, we calculate '+': 3 + 5 = 8, so the expression becomes 8 / 4 * 3.\nStep2: Then we calculate '/': 8 / 4 = 2.0, so the expression becomes 2.0 * 3.\nStep3: Finally, 2.0 * 3 = 6.0, so this answer choice evaluates to 6.0.\n\nFor D: The value of 3 + 5 / 4 * 3 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '*' > '/' = '+', '*' has the highest priority, followed by '/' and '+', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '*' has the highest priority, we calculate '*' first: 4 * 3 = 12, so the expression becomes 3 + 5 / 12.\nStep2: Since '/' and '+' have the same priority. Now we evaluate the expression from left to right. 3 + 5 = 8, so the expression becomes 8 / 12.\nStep3: Finally, 8 / 12 = 0.6666666666666666, so this answer choice evaluates to 0.6666666666666666.\n\nGiven above, only with choice C, the expression evaluates to 6.0, so the correct answer should be [C]\n\nFor the expression 4 + 4 / 9 * 3, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

This answer choice evaluates to -1.2222222222222223.\n\nFor C: The value of 7 / 9 + 2 - 4 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '/' > '+' = '-', '/' has the highest priority, followed by '+' and '-', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '/' has the highest priority, we calculate '/' first: 7 / 9 = 0.7777777777777778, so the expression becomes 0.7777777777777778 + 2 - 4.\nStep2: Since '+' and '-' have the same priority, we evaluate the expression from left to right: 0.7777777777777778 + 2 = 2.777777777777778.\nStep3: Finally, 2.777777777777778 - 4 = -1.2222222222222223, so this answer choice evaluates to -1.2222222222222223.\n\nFor D: The value of 7 / 9 + 2 - 4 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '+' > '/' > '-', '+' has the highest priority, followed by '/', and '-' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '+' has the highest priority, we calculate '+' first: 2 - 4 = -2, so the expression becomes 7 / 9 - 2.\nStep2: Since '/' has priority over '-', we then calculate '/': 7 / 9 = 0.7777777777777778, so the expression becomes 0.7777777777777778 - 2.\nStep3: Finally, 0.7777777777777778 - 2 = -1.2222222222222223, so this answer choice evaluates to -1.2222222222222223.\n\nNone of the options A, B, C, or D result in the expression evaluating to 1.0. It seems there might be an error in the provided options or the question itself. However, if we were to find the correct precedence that results in the expression evaluating to 1.0, we can work backwards from the desired result:\n\nWe want the expression to equal 1.0:\n7 / 9 + 2 - 4 = 1.0\n\nLet's try to adjust the expression to reach the desired result:\n(7 / 9) + (2 - 4) = 1.0\n0.7777777777777778 - 2 = 1.0\n-1.2222222222222223 + 2 = 1.0\n0.7777777777777778 = 1.0\n\nThis is not correct. Instead, let's try another approach:\n(7 / (9 + 2)) - 4 = 1.0\n(7 / 11) - 4 = 1.0\n0.6363636363636364 - 4 = 1.0\n-3.3636363636363638 ≠ 1.0\n\nThis is also not correct. The correct approach should be:\n7 / (9 + (2 - 4)) = 1.0\n7 / (9 - 2) = 1.0\n7 / 7 = 1.0\n1.0 = 1.0\n\nThis is correct. So the correct precedence that results in the expression evaluating to 1.0 is '/' > ('+' > '-'), which is not listed in the provided options. If we were to fit this into the given options, it would be closest to option C, where '/' has the highest priority, but the '+' and '-' precedence is not correctly defined in any of the options. Therefore, the correct precedence is not represented by any of the given choices."

Please choose the correct answer from A, B, C, and D, and put the final answer choice in brackets, for example, [B].\nA. '+' = '/' > '-'\nB. '-' = '/' = '+'\nC. '/' > '+' = '-'\nD. '+' > '/' = '-'\n\n[Answer]: \nUsing the precedence rule in the correct answer choice, the expression 3 - 6 / 9 + 9 should evaluate to 8.666666666666666. We test four options one by one.\nFor A: The value of 3 - 6 / 9 + 9 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '+' = '/' > '-', '+' and '/' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '-'\nStep1: Since '+' and '/' have the same priority over -, we evaluate '+' and '/' from left to right. In this case, '/' comes before '+', so we calculate '/' first: 6 / 9 = 0.6666666666666666, so the expression becomes 3 - 0.6666666666666666 + 9.\nStep2: '+' has priority over '-'. Now we calculate '+': 0.6666666666666666 + 9 = 9.666666666666666, so the expression becomes 3 - 9.666666666666666.\nStep3: Finally, 3 - 9.666666666666666 = -6.666666666666666, so this answer choice evaluates to -6.666666666666666.\n\nFor B: The value of 3 - 6 / 9 + 9 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '-' = '/' = '+', -, /, and + have the same priority,so we can evaluate the expression from left to right\nStep1: Firstly, we calculate '-': 3 - 6 = -3, so the expression becomes -3 / 9 + 9.\nStep2: Then we calculate '/': -3 / 9 = -0.3333333333333333, so the expression becomes -0.3333333333333333 + 9.\nStep3: Finally, -0.3333333333333333 + 9 = 8.666666666666666, so this answer choice evaluates to 8.666666666666666.\n\nFor C: The value of 3 - 6 / 9 + 9 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '/' > '+' = '-', '/' has the highest priority, followed by '+' and '-', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '/' has the highest priority, we calculate '/' first: 6 / 9 = 0.6666666666666666, so the expression becomes 3 - 0.6666666666666666 + 9.\nStep2: Since '+' and '-' have the same priority. Now we evaluate the expression from left to right. 3 - 0.6666666666666666 = 2.3333333333333335, so the expression becomes 2.3333333333333335 + 9.\nStep3: Finally, 2.3333333333333335 + 9 = 11.333333333333334, so this answer choice evaluates to 11.333333333333334.\n\nFor D: The value of 3 - 6 / 9 + 9 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '+' > '/' = '-', '+' has the highest priority, followed by '/' and '-', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '+' has the highest priority, we calculate '+' first: 9 + 9 = 18, so the expression becomes 3 - 6 / 18.\nStep2: Since '/' and '-' have the same priority. Now we evaluate the expression from left to right. 3 - 6 = -3, so the expression becomes -3 / 18.\nStep3: Finally, -3 / 18 = -0.16666666666666666, so this answer choice evaluates to -0.16666666666666666.\n\nGiven above, only with choice B, the expression evaluates to 8.666666666666666, so the correct answer should be [B]\n\nFor the expression 6 - 6 / 9 + 3, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

However, if we were to redefine the precedence to match the result of 5.5, we would need to ensure that the division occurs last. Let's try to redefine the precedence to match the result:\n\nIf we perform the addition first, then the subtraction, and finally the division, we get:\nStep1: '+' first: 6 + 3 = 9, so the expression becomes 6 - 9 / 9.\nStep2: '-' next: 6 - 9 = -3, so the expression becomes -3 / 9.\nStep3: '/' last: -3 / 9 = -0.3333333333333333.\n\nThis does not result in 5.5 either. To achieve the result of 5.5, the correct order of operations would be to perform the subtraction first, then the addition, and finally the division:\n\nStep1: '-' first: 6 - 6 = 0, so the expression becomes 0 / 9 + 3.\nStep2: '+' next: 0 + 3 = 3, so the expression becomes 3 / 9.\nStep3: '/' last: 3 / 9 = 0.3333333333333333, and adding this to the previous result of 3, we get 3 + 0.3333333333333333 = 3.3333333333333335, which is not 5.5.\n\nIt seems that none of the redefined precedence rules provided in options A, B, C, or D will result in the expression 6 - 6 / 9 + 3 equaling 5.5.

We test four options one by one.\nFor A: The value of 8 / 7 + 6 - 3 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '-' > '+' > '/', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '+'. '/' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '-' has the highest priority, we calculate '-' first: 6 - 3 = 3, so the expression becomes 8 / 7 + 3.\nStep2: Since '+' has priority over '/', we then calculate '+': 7 + 3 = 10, so the expression becomes 8 / 10.\nStep3: Finally, 8 / 10 = 0.8, so this answer choice evaluates to 0.8.\n\nFor B: The value of 8 / 7 + 6 - 3 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '-' = '+' > '/', '-' and '+' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '/'\nStep1: Since '-' and '+' have the same priority over /, we evaluate '-' and '+' from left to right. In this case, '+' comes before '-', so we calculate '+' first: 7 + 6 = 13, so the expression becomes 8 / 13 - 3.\nStep2: '-' has priority over '/'. Now we calculate '-': 13 - 3 = 10, so the expression becomes 8 / 10.\nStep3: Finally, 8 / 10 = 0.8, so this answer choice evaluates to 0.8.\n\nFor C: The value of 8 / 7 + 6 - 3 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '/' > '+' = '-', '/' has the highest priority, followed by '+' and '-', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '/' has the highest priority, we calculate '/' first: 8 / 7 = 1.1428571428571428, so the expression becomes 1.1428571428571428 + 6 - 3.\nStep2: Since '+' and '-' have the same priority. Now we evaluate the expression from left to right. 1.1428571428571428 + 6 = 7.142857142857142, so the expression becomes 7.142857142857142 - 3.\nStep3: Finally, 7.142857142857142 - 3 = 4.142857142857142, so this answer choice evaluates to 4.142857142857142.\n\nFor D: The value of 8 / 7 + 6 - 3 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '+' > '-' = '/', '+' has the highest priority, followed by '-' and '/', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '+' has the highest priority, we calculate '+' first: 7 + 6 = 13, so the expression becomes 8 / 13 - 3.\nStep2: Since '-' and '/' have the same priority.

However, let's try to find the correct precedence by working backward from the result:\n\nTo get 5.4 from the expression 6 - 9 / 8 + 7, we can try the following calculation:\nStep1: If '/' has the highest priority, we calculate '/' first: 9 / 8 = 1.125, so the expression becomes 6 - 1.125 + 7.\nStep2: If '+' has the next highest priority, we calculate '+': 6 + 7 = 13, so the expression becomes 13 - 1.125.\nStep3: Finally, 13 - 1.125 = 11.875, which is not the desired result.\n\nLet's try another order:\nStep1: If '-' has the highest priority, we calculate '-' first: 6 - 9 = -3, so the expression becomes -3 / 8 + 7.\nStep2: If '+' has the next highest priority, we calculate '+': -3 + 7 = 4, so the expression becomes 4 / 8.\nStep3: Finally, 4 / 8 = 0.5, which is not the desired result.\n\nThe correct order that gives us 5.4 would be:\nStep1: Calculate '/' first: 9 / 8 = 1.125, so the expression becomes 6 - 1.125 + 7.\nStep2: Calculate '-' next: 6 - 1.125 = 4.875, so the expression becomes 4.875 + 7.\nStep3: Calculate '+' last: 4.875 + 7 = 11.875, which is not the desired result.\n\nIt seems that none of the combinations of the given precedence rules result in the expression evaluating to 5.4. There might be a mistake in the question or the provided answer choices. If the expression is supposed to evaluate to 5.4, then the precedence that would give this result is not listed among the options A, B, C, or D."

Now we evaluate the expression from left to right. 2 + 0.7142857142857143 = 2.7142857142857144, so the expression becomes 2.7142857142857144 * 8.\nStep3: Finally, 2.7142857142857144 * 8 = 21.714285714285715, so this answer choice evaluates to 21.714285714285715.\n\nFor C: The value of 2 + 5 / 7 * 8 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '/' > '*' > '+', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '*'.

We test four options one by one.\nFor A: The value of 8 * 8 / 3 - 5 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '-' = '*' > '/', '-' and '*' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '/'\nStep1: Since '-' and '*' have the same priority over /, we evaluate '-' and '*' from left to right. In this case, '*' comes before '-', so we calculate '*' first: 8 * 8 = 64, so the expression becomes 64 / 3 - 5.\nStep2: '-' has priority over '/'. Now we calculate '-': 3 - 5 = -2, so the expression becomes 64 / -2.\nStep3: Finally, 64 / -2 = -32.0, so this answer choice evaluates to -32.0.\n\nFor B: The value of 8 * 8 / 3 - 5 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '*' > '/' = '-', '*' has the highest priority, followed by '/' and '-', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '*' has the highest priority, we calculate '*' first: 8 * 8 = 64, so the expression becomes 64 / 3 - 5.\nStep2: Since '/' and '-' have the same priority. Now we evaluate the expression from left to right. 64 / 3 = 21.333333333333332, so the expression becomes 21.333333333333332 - 5.\nStep3: Finally, 21.333333333333332 - 5 = 16.333333333333332, so this answer choice evaluates to 16.333333333333332.\n\nFor C: The value of 8 * 8 / 3 - 5 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '/' = '-' > '*', '/' and '-' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '*'\nStep1: Since '/' and '-' have the same priority over *, we evaluate '/' and '-' from left to right. In this case, '/' comes before '-', so we calculate '/' first: 8 / 3 = 2.6666666666666665, so the expression becomes 8 * 2.6666666666666665 - 5.\nStep2: '-' has priority over '*'. Now we calculate '-': 2.6666666666666665 - 5 = -2.3333333333333335, so the expression becomes 8 * -2.3333333333333335.\nStep3: Finally, 8 * -2.3333333333333335 = -18.666666666666668, so this answer choice evaluates to -18.666666666666668.\n\nFor D: The value of 8 * 8 / 3 - 5 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '-' > '/' > '*', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '/'. '*' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '-' has the highest priority, we calculate '-' first: 3 - 5 = -2, so the expression becomes 8 * 8 / -2.\nStep2: Since '/' has priority over '*', we then calculate '/': 8 / -2 = -4.0, so the expression becomes 8 * -4.0.\nStep3: Finally, 8 * -4.0 = -32.0, so this answer choice evaluates to -32.0.\n\nGiven above, only with choice B, the expression evaluates to 16.333333333333332, so the correct answer should be [B]\n\nFor the expression 9 / 3 - 2 * 7, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

'*' > '-' = '/'\n\n[Answer]: \nUsing the precedence rule in the correct answer choice, the expression 9 / 5 * 4 - 7 should evaluate to 0.20000000000000018. We test four options one by one.\nFor A: The value of 9 / 5 * 4 - 7 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '/' = '*' = '-', /, *, and - have the same priority,so we can evaluate the expression from left to right\nStep1: Firstly, we calculate '/': 9 / 5 = 1.8, so the expression becomes 1.8 * 4 - 7.\nStep2: Then we calculate '*': 1.8 * 4 = 7.2, so the expression becomes 7.2 - 7.\nStep3: Finally, 7.2 - 7 = 0.20000000000000018, so this answer choice evaluates to 0.20000000000000018.\n\nFor B: The value of 9 / 5 * 4 - 7 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '-' > '/' > '*', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '/'. '*' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '-' has the highest priority, we calculate '-' first: 4 - 7 = -3, so the expression becomes 9 / 5 * -3.\nStep2: Since '/' has priority over '*', we then calculate '/': 9 / 5 = 1.8, so the expression becomes 1.8 * -3.\nStep3: Finally, 1.8 * -3 = -5.4, so this answer choice evaluates to -5.4.\n\nFor C: The value of 9 / 5 * 4 - 7 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '*' = '-' > '/', '*' and '-' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '/'\nStep1: Since '*' and '-' have the same priority over /, we evaluate '*' and '-' from left to right. In this case, '*' comes before '-', so we calculate '*' first: 5 * 4 = 20, so the expression becomes 9 / 20 - 7.\nStep2: '-' has priority over '/'. Now we calculate '-': 20 - 7 = 13, so the expression becomes 9 / 13.\nStep3: Finally, 9 / 13 = 0.6923076923076923, so this answer choice evaluates to 0.6923076923076923.\n\nFor D: The value of 9 / 5 * 4 - 7 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '*' > '-' = '/', '*' has the highest priority, followed by '-' and '/', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '*' has the highest priority, we calculate '*' first: 5 * 4 = 20, so the expression becomes 9 / 20 - 7.\nStep2: Since '-' and '/' have the same priority. Now we evaluate the expression from left to right. 9 / 20 = 0.45, so the expression becomes 0.45 - 7.\nStep3: Finally, 0.45 - 7 = -6.55, so this answer choice evaluates to -6.55.\n\nGiven above, only with choice A, the expression evaluates to 0.20000000000000018, so the correct answer should be [A]\n\nFor the expression 7 / 3 - 7 * 6, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

In this case, '/' comes before '-', so we calculate '/': 7 / 3 = 2.3333333333333335, so the expression becomes 2.3333333333333335 - 7 * 6.\nStep2: Now we calculate '-': 2.3333333333333335 - 7 = -4.666666666666667, so the expression becomes -4.666666666666667 * 6.\nStep3: Finally, -4.666666666666667 * 6 = -28, so this answer choice evaluates to -28.\n\nFor D: The value of 7 / 3 - 7 * 6 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '-' = '*' > '/', '-' and '*' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '/'.\nStep1: Since '-' and '*' have the same priority, we evaluate '-' and '*' from left to right. In this case, '-' comes before '*', so we calculate '-': 3 - 7 = -4, so the expression becomes 7 / -4 * 6.\nStep2: Now we calculate '/': 7 / -4 = -1.75, so the expression becomes -1.75 * 6.\nStep3: Finally, -1.75 * 6 = -10.5, so this answer choice evaluates to -10.5.\n\nNone of the options A, B, C, or D result in the value -0.2916666666666667. It seems there might be an error in the provided options or the expected result. However, let's try to find the correct precedence by working backward from the expected result:\n\nWe want to find an operation order that results in -0.2916666666666667. Let's start by assuming the subtraction happens last, as it's the only way to get a negative fraction:\n\nStep1: We need to find the result of 7 / 3 * 6 that when subtracted from 7 gives us -0.2916666666666667.\nStep2: Adding 0.2916666666666667 to 7 gives us 7.291666666666667.\nStep3: Now we need to find if there's a way to get 7.291666666666667 by multiplying 6 with the result of 7 / 3.\nStep4: 7 / 3 = 2.3333333333333335, and 2.3333333333333335 * 6 = 14, which is not equal to 7.291666666666667.\n\nIt seems that the subtraction must happen before the multiplication. Let's try that:\n\nStep1: We need to find the result of 7 / (3 - 7 * 6) that equals -0.2916666666666667.\nStep2: Inverting the operation, we multiply -0.2916666666666667 by (3 - 7 * 6) to get 7.\nStep3: 3 - 7 * 6 = 3 - 42 = -39.\nStep4: -0.2916666666666667 * -39 should equal 7.\nStep5: Indeed, -0.2916666666666667 * -39 = 7.\n\nThis means the subtraction must have a higher precedence than both division and multiplication. However, this does not match any of the provided options. There might be a mistake in the question or the options provided. If we were to define a precedence that matches the result, it would be:\n\nE. '-' > '*' and '/'\n\nSince this option is not provided, we cannot select a correct answer from the given choices."

In this case, '+' comes before '-', so we calculate '+' first: 3 + 4 = 7, so the expression becomes 7 * 6 - 7.\nStep2: '-' has priority over '*'. Now we calculate '-': 6 - 7 = -1, so the expression becomes 7 * -1.\nStep3: Finally, 7 * -1 = -7, so this answer choice evaluates to -7.\n\nFor B: The value of 3 + 4 * 6 - 7 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '-' = '+' > '*', '-' and '+' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '*'\nStep1: Since '-' and '+' have the same priority over *, we evaluate '-' and '+' from left to right. In this case, '+' comes before '-', so we calculate '+' first: 3 + 4 = 7, so the expression becomes 7 * 6 - 7.\nStep2: '-' has priority over '*'. Now we calculate '-': 6 - 7 = -1, so the expression becomes 7 * -1.\nStep3: Finally, 7 * -1 = -7, so this answer choice evaluates to -7.\n\nFor C: The value of 3 + 4 * 6 - 7 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '*' > '+' = '-', '*' has the highest priority, followed by '+' and '-', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '*' has the highest priority, we calculate '*' first: 4 * 6 = 24, so the expression becomes 3 + 24 - 7.\nStep2: Since '+' and '-' have the same priority. Now we evaluate the expression from left to right. 3 + 24 = 27, so the expression becomes 27 - 7.\nStep3: Finally, 27 - 7 = 20, so this answer choice evaluates to 20.\n\nFor D: The value of 3 + 4 * 6 - 7 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '+' > '*' > '-', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '*'. '-' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '+' has the highest priority, we calculate '+' first: 3 + 4 = 7, so the expression becomes 7 * 6 - 7.\nStep2: Since '*' has priority over '-', we then calculate '*': 7 * 6 = 42, so the expression becomes 42 - 7.\nStep3: Finally, 42 - 7 = 35, so this answer choice evaluates to 35.\n\nGiven above, only with choice D, the expression evaluates to 35, so the correct answer should be [D]\n\nFor the expression 4 - 9 * 9 + 8, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

First, we calculate '*': 9 * 17 = 153, so the expression becomes 4 - 153.\nStep3: Finally, 4 - 153 = -149, so this answer choice does not evaluate to -37.\n\nFor C: The value of 4 - 9 * 9 + 8 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '-' = '+' > '*', '-' and '+' have the same highest priority, and '*' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '-' and '+' have the same priority, we evaluate them from left to right. First, we calculate '-': 4 - 9 = -5, so the expression becomes -5 * 9 + 8.\nStep2: Continuing from left to right, we calculate '+': -5 * 9 = -45, so the expression becomes -45 + 8.\nStep3: Finally, -45 + 8 = -37, so this answer choice evaluates to -37.\n\nFor D: The value of 4 - 9 * 9 + 8 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '-' > '*' = '+', '-' has the highest priority, and '*' and '+' have the same lower priority.\nStep1: Since '-' has the highest priority, we calculate '-' first: 4 - 9 = -5, so the expression becomes -5 * 9 + 8.\nStep2: Since '*' and '+' have the same priority, we evaluate them from left to right. First, we calculate '*': -5 * 9 = -45, so the expression becomes -45 + 8.\nStep3: Finally, -45 + 8 = -37, so this answer choice also evaluates to -37.\n\nGiven the above, both choices A and C evaluate the expression to -37. However, since the question specifies that the expression 4 - 9 * 9 + 8 equals -37, we need to choose the option that correctly reflects the redefined precedence of the operators. Since option A suggests that '-' has a higher precedence than '+', which is not possible because it would not allow for the '+' operation to be performed before the '*' operation (which is necessary to get the result of -37), we can eliminate option A.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be [C]."

'*' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '+' has the highest priority, we calculate '+' first: 5 + 6 = 11, so the expression becomes 11 - 9 * 9.\nStep2: Since '-' has priority over '*', we then calculate '-': 11 - 9 = 2, so the expression becomes 2 * 9.\nStep3: Finally, 2 * 9 = 18, so this answer choice evaluates to 18.\n\nFor B: The value of 5 + 6 - 9 * 9 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '*' > '+' > '-', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '+'. '-' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '*' has the highest priority, we calculate '*' first: 9 * 9 = 81, so the expression becomes 5 + 6 - 81.\nStep2: Since '+' has priority over '-', we then calculate '+': 5 + 6 = 11, so the expression becomes 11 - 81.\nStep3: Finally, 11 - 81 = -70, so this answer choice evaluates to -70.\n\nFor C: The value of 5 + 6 - 9 * 9 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '*' > '-' > '+', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '-'.

In this case, '-' comes before '*', so we calculate '-' first: 6 - 9 = -3, so the expression becomes 5 + -3 * 9.\nStep2: '*' has priority over '+'. Now we calculate '*': -3 * 9 = -27, so the expression becomes 5 + -27.\nStep3: Finally, 5 + -27 = -22, so this answer choice evaluates to -22.\n\nGiven above, only with choice A, the expression evaluates to 18, so the correct answer should be [A]\n\nFor the expression 4 - 1 * 5 + 1, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

'*' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '-' has the highest priority, we calculate '-' first: 7 - 5 = 2, so the expression becomes 7 / 6 * 2.\nStep2: Since '/' has priority over '*', we then calculate '/': 7 / 6 = 1.1666666666666667, so the expression becomes 1.1666666666666667 * 2.\nStep3: Finally, 1.1666666666666667 * 2 = 2.3333333333333335, so this answer choice evaluates to 2.3333333333333335.\n\nFor B: The value of 7 / 6 * 7 - 5 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '-' = '*' > '/', '-' and '*' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '/'\nStep1: Since '-' and '*' have the same priority over /, we evaluate '-' and '*' from left to right.

We test four options one by one.\nFor A: The value of 8 * 8 + 7 - 5 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '+' > '*' > '-', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '*'. '-' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '+' has the highest priority, we calculate '+' first: 8 + 7 = 15, so the expression becomes 8 * 15 - 5.\nStep2: Since '*' has priority over '-', we then calculate '*': 8 * 15 = 120, so the expression becomes 120 - 5.\nStep3: Finally, 120 - 5 = 115, so this answer choice evaluates to 115.\n\nFor B: The value of 8 * 8 + 7 - 5 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '*' > '+' = '-', '*' has the highest priority, followed by '+' and '-', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '*' has the highest priority, we calculate '*' first: 8 * 8 = 64, so the expression becomes 64 + 7 - 5.\nStep2: Since '+' and '-' have the same priority.

'-' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '+' has the highest priority, we calculate '+' first: 9 + 3 = 12, so the expression becomes 3 * 12 - 8.\nStep2: Since '*' has priority over '-', we then calculate '*': 3 * 12 = 36, so the expression becomes 36 - 8.\nStep3: Finally, 36 - 8 = 28, so this answer choice evaluates to 28.\n\nFor C: The value of 3 * 9 + 3 - 8 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '-' = '+' > '*', '-' and '+' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '*'\nStep1: Since '-' and '+' have the same priority over *, we evaluate '-' and '+' from left to right. In this case, '+' comes before '-', so we calculate '+' first: 9 + 3 = 12, so the expression becomes 3 * 12 - 8.\nStep2: '-' has priority over '*'. Now we calculate '-': 12 - 8 = 4, so the expression becomes 3 * 4.\nStep3: Finally, 3 * 4 = 12, so this answer choice evaluates to 12.\n\nFor D: The value of 3 * 9 + 3 - 8 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '*' = '+' = '-', *, +, and - have the same priority,so we can evaluate the expression from left to right\nStep1: Firstly, we calculate '*': 3 * 9 = 27, so the expression becomes 27 + 3 - 8.\nStep2: Then we calculate '+': 27 + 3 = 30, so the expression becomes 30 - 8.\nStep3: Finally, 30 - 8 = 22, so this answer choice evaluates to 22.\n\nGiven above, only with choice D, the expression evaluates to 22, so the correct answer should be [D]\n\nFor the expression 4 * 5 + 1 - 8, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

'*' = '/' > '+'\n\n[Answer]: \nUsing the precedence rule in the correct answer choice, the expression 8 / 9 + 9 * 9 should evaluate to 89.0. We test four options one by one.\nFor A: The value of 8 / 9 + 9 * 9 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '/' > '+' > '*', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '+'. '*' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '/' has the highest priority, we calculate '/' first: 8 / 9 = 0.8888888888888888, so the expression becomes 0.8888888888888888 + 9 * 9.\nStep2: Since '+' has priority over '*', we then calculate '+': 0.8888888888888888 + 9 = 9.88888888888889, so the expression becomes 9.88888888888889 * 9.\nStep3: Finally, 9.88888888888889 * 9 = 89.0, so this answer choice evaluates to 89.0.\n\nFor B: The value of 8 / 9 + 9 * 9 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '+' = '*' > '/', '+' and '*' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '/'\nStep1: Since '+' and '*' have the same priority over /, we evaluate '+' and '*' from left to right. In this case, '+' comes before '*', so we calculate '+' first: 9 + 9 = 18, so the expression becomes 8 / 18 * 9.\nStep2: '*' has priority over '/'. Now we calculate '*': 18 * 9 = 162, so the expression becomes 8 / 162.\nStep3: Finally, 8 / 162 = 0.04938271604938271, so this answer choice evaluates to 0.04938271604938271.\n\nFor C: The value of 8 / 9 + 9 * 9 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '+' > '/' > '*', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '/'. '*' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '+' has the highest priority, we calculate '+' first: 9 + 9 = 18, so the expression becomes 8 / 18 * 9.\nStep2: Since '/' has priority over '*', we then calculate '/': 8 / 18 = 0.4444444444444444, so the expression becomes 0.4444444444444444 * 9.\nStep3: Finally, 0.4444444444444444 * 9 = 4.0, so this answer choice evaluates to 4.0.\n\nFor D: The value of 8 / 9 + 9 * 9 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '*' = '/' > '+', '*' and '/' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '+'\nStep1: Since '*' and '/' have the same priority over +, we evaluate '*' and '/' from left to right. In this case, '/' comes before '*', so we calculate '/' first: 8 / 9 = 0.8888888888888888, so the expression becomes 0.8888888888888888 + 9 * 9.\nStep2: '*' has priority over '+'.

We test four options one by one.\nFor A: The value of 8 * 6 / 9 + 9 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '/' = '+' > '*', '/' and '+' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '*'\nStep1: Since '/' and '+' have the same priority over *, we evaluate '/' and '+' from left to right. In this case, '/' comes before '+', so we calculate '/' first: 6 / 9 = 0.6666666666666666, so the expression becomes 8 * 0.6666666666666666 + 9.\nStep2: '+' has priority over '*'. Now we calculate '+': 0.6666666666666666 + 9 = 9.666666666666666, so the expression becomes 8 * 9.666666666666666.\nStep3: Finally, 8 * 9.666666666666666 = 77.33333333333333, so this answer choice evaluates to 77.33333333333333.\n\nFor B: The value of 8 * 6 / 9 + 9 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '+' > '*' = '/', '+' has the highest priority, followed by '*' and '/', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '+' has the highest priority, we calculate '+' first: 9 + 9 = 18, so the expression becomes 8 * 6 / 18.\nStep2: Since '*' and '/' have the same priority. Now we evaluate the expression from left to right. 8 * 6 = 48, so the expression becomes 48 / 18.\nStep3: Finally, 48 / 18 = 2.6666666666666665, so this answer choice evaluates to 2.6666666666666665.\n\nFor C: The value of 8 * 6 / 9 + 9 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '*' > '+' > '/', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '+'. '/' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '*' has the highest priority, we calculate '*' first: 8 * 6 = 48, so the expression becomes 48 / 9 + 9.\nStep2: Since '+' has priority over '/', we then calculate '+': 9 + 9 = 18, so the expression becomes 48 / 18.\nStep3: Finally, 48 / 18 = 2.6666666666666665, so this answer choice evaluates to 2.6666666666666665.\n\nFor D: The value of 8 * 6 / 9 + 9 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '*' > '/' > '+', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '/'. '+' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '*' has the highest priority, we calculate '*' first: 8 * 6 = 48, so the expression becomes 48 / 9 + 9.\nStep2: Since '/' has priority over '+', we then calculate '/': 48 / 9 = 5.333333333333333, so the expression becomes 5.333333333333333 + 9.\nStep3: Finally, 5.333333333333333 + 9 = 14.333333333333332, so this answer choice evaluates to 14.333333333333332.\n\nGiven above, only with choice D, the expression evaluates to 14.333333333333332, so the correct answer should be [D]\n\nFor the expression 3 / 1 + 4 * 3, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

Now we calculate '/': -2 / 9 = -0.2222222222222222, so the expression becomes 4 + -0.2222222222222222.\nStep3: Finally, 4 + -0.2222222222222222 = 3.7777777777777777, so this answer choice evaluates to 3.7777777777777777.\n\nFor C: The value of 4 + 5 - 7 / 9 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '+' > '-' = '/', '+' has the highest priority, followed by '-' and '/', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '+' has the highest priority, we calculate '+' first: 4 + 5 = 9, so the expression becomes 9 - 7 / 9.\nStep2: Since '-' and '/' have the same priority. Now we evaluate the expression from left to right. 9 - 7 = 2, so the expression becomes 2 / 9.\nStep3: Finally, 2 / 9 = 0.2222222222222222, so this answer choice evaluates to 0.2222222222222222.\n\nFor D: The value of 4 + 5 - 7 / 9 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '+' > '/' > '-', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '/'. '-' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '+' has the highest priority, we calculate '+' first: 4 + 5 = 9, so the expression becomes 9 - 7 / 9.\nStep2: Since '/' has priority over '-', we then calculate '/': 7 / 9 = 0.7777777777777778, so the expression becomes 9 - 0.7777777777777778.\nStep3: Finally, 9 - 0.7777777777777778 = 8.222222222222221, so this answer choice evaluates to 8.222222222222221.\n\nGiven above, only with choice C, the expression evaluates to 0.2222222222222222, so the correct answer should be [C]\n\nFor the expression 7 / 7 - 3 + 8, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

Now we evaluate the expression from left to right. 1.5 + 5 = 6.5, so the expression becomes 6.5 - 5.\nStep3: Finally, 6.5 - 5 = 1.5, so this answer choice evaluates to 1.5.\n\nFor B: The value of 6 / 4 + 5 - 5 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '+' > '/' > '-', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '/'. '-' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '+' has the highest priority, we calculate '+' first: 4 + 5 = 9, so the expression becomes 6 / 9 - 5.\nStep2: Since '/' has priority over '-', we then calculate '/': 6 / 9 = 0.6666666666666666, so the expression becomes 0.6666666666666666 - 5.\nStep3: Finally, 0.6666666666666666 - 5 = -4.333333333333333, so this answer choice evaluates to -4.333333333333333.\n\nFor C: The value of 6 / 4 + 5 - 5 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '+' > '-' = '/', '+' has the highest priority, followed by '-' and '/', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '+' has the highest priority, we calculate '+' first: 4 + 5 = 9, so the expression becomes 6 / 9 - 5.\nStep2: Since '-' and '/' have the same priority. Now we evaluate the expression from left to right. 6 / 9 = 0.6666666666666666, so the expression becomes 0.6666666666666666 - 5.\nStep3: Finally, 0.6666666666666666 - 5 = -4.333333333333333, so this answer choice evaluates to -4.333333333333333.\n\nFor D: The value of 6 / 4 + 5 - 5 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '+' > '/' = '-', '+' has the highest priority, followed by '/' and '-', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '+' has the highest priority, we calculate '+' first: 4 + 5 = 9, so the expression becomes 6 / 9 - 5.\nStep2: Since '/' and '-' have the same priority. Now we evaluate the expression from left to right. 6 / 9 = 0.6666666666666666, so the expression becomes 0.6666666666666666 - 5.\nStep3: Finally, 0.6666666666666666 - 5 = -4.333333333333333, so this answer choice evaluates to -4.333333333333333.\n\nGiven above, only with choice A, the expression evaluates to 1.5, so the correct answer should be [A]\n\nFor the expression 6 - 7 + 1 / 2, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

'-' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '*' has the highest priority, we calculate '*' first: 5 * 3 = 15, so the expression becomes 5 / 15 - 3.\nStep2: Since '/' has priority over '-', we then calculate '/': 5 / 15 = 0.3333333333333333, so the expression becomes 0.3333333333333333 - 3.\nStep3: Finally, 0.3333333333333333 - 3 = -2.6666666666666665, so this answer choice evaluates to -2.6666666666666665.\n\nFor B: The value of 5 / 5 * 3 - 3 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '*' > '-' = '/', '*' has the highest priority, followed by '-' and '/', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '*' has the highest priority, we calculate '*' first: 5 * 3 = 15, so the expression becomes 5 / 15 - 3.\nStep2: Since '-' and '/' have the same priority. Now we evaluate the expression from left to right. 5 / 15 = 0.3333333333333333, so the expression becomes 0.3333333333333333 - 3.\nStep3: Finally, 0.3333333333333333 - 3 = -2.6666666666666665, so this answer choice evaluates to -2.6666666666666665.\n\nFor C: The value of 5 / 5 * 3 - 3 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '/' = '*' > '-', '/' and '*' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '-'\nStep1: Since '/' and '*' have the same priority over -, we evaluate '/' and '*' from left to right. In this case, '/' comes before '*', so we calculate '/' first: 5 / 5 = 1.0, so the expression becomes 1.0 * 3 - 3.\nStep2: '*' has priority over '-'. Now we calculate '*': 1.0 * 3 = 3.0, so the expression becomes 3.0 - 3.\nStep3: Finally, 3.0 - 3 = 0.0, so this answer choice evaluates to 0.0.\n\nFor D: The value of 5 / 5 * 3 - 3 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '*' = '-' > '/', '*' and '-' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '/'\nStep1: Since '*' and '-' have the same priority over /, we evaluate '*' and '-' from left to right. In this case, '*' comes before '-', so we calculate '*' first: 5 * 3 = 15, so the expression becomes 5 / 15 - 3.\nStep2: '-' has priority over '/'. Now we calculate '-': 15 - 3 = 12, so the expression becomes 5 / 12.\nStep3: Finally, 5 / 12 = 0.4166666666666667, so this answer choice evaluates to 0.4166666666666667.\n\nGiven above, only with choice C, the expression evaluates to 0.0, so the correct answer should be [C]\n\nFor the expression 3 / 2 * 3 - 9, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

We test four options one by one.\nFor A: The value of 4 + 9 / 6 - 8 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '-' > '/' = '+', '-' has the highest priority, followed by '/' and '+', which have the same priority.\nStep1: Since '-' has the highest priority, we calculate '-' first: 6 - 8 = -2, so the expression becomes 4 + 9 / -2.\nStep2: Since '/' and '+' have the same priority. Now we evaluate the expression from left to right. 4 + 9 = 13, so the expression becomes 13 / -2.\nStep3: Finally, 13 / -2 = -6.5, so this answer choice evaluates to -6.5.\n\nFor B: The value of 4 + 9 / 6 - 8 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '-' > '+' > '/', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '+'. '/' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '-' has the highest priority, we calculate '-' first: 6 - 8 = -2, so the expression becomes 4 + 9 / -2.\nStep2: Since '+' has priority over '/', we then calculate '+': 4 + 9 = 13, so the expression becomes 13 / -2.\nStep3: Finally, 13 / -2 = -6.5, so this answer choice evaluates to -6.5.\n\nFor C: The value of 4 + 9 / 6 - 8 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '+' > '/' > '-', '[0]' has the highest priority, followed by '/'.
