Now we evaluate the expression from left to right. 9 - 5 = 4, so the expression becomes 4 + 0.2857142857142857.\nStep3: Finally, 4 + 0.2857142857142857 = 4.285714285714286, so this answer choice evaluates to 4.285714285714286.\n\nSimilarly, we evaluate the expressions in B, C, and D in the same way as we evaluate the expression in A.\nFor B: using the precedence rule of choice B: '-' > '+' = '/', the expression 9 - 5 + 2 / 7 evaluates to 0.8571428571428571\nFor C: using the precedence rule of choice C: '-' = '/' > '+', the expression 9 - 5 + 2 / 7 evaluates to 4.285714285714286\nFor D: using the precedence rule of choice D: '-' > '/' > '+', the expression 9 - 5 + 2 / 7 evaluates to 4.285714285714286\nGiven above, only with choice B, the expression evaluates to 0.8571428571428571, so the correct answer should be [B]\n\nFor the expression 7 / 9 + 2 - 4, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

Subtract 1 from 7 to get 6.\n2. Multiply 6 by 9 to get 54.\n3. Divide 54 by 3 to get 18.\n\nSo the correct precedence to get the result of 18.666666666666664 would be '-' > '*' > '/'. However, this option is not provided in the choices. There seems to be an error in the question or the answer choices. If we assume that the correct precedence is indeed '-' > '*' > '/', then the correct answer would be an option not listed, which we can denote as [E] for the sake of this example."

'*' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '/' has the highest priority, we calculate '/' first: 8 / 7 = 1.1428571428571428, so the expression becomes 5 * 1.1428571428571428 - 2.\nStep2: Since '-' has priority over '*', we then calculate '-': 1.1428571428571428 - 2 = -0.8571428571428572, so the expression becomes 5 * -0.8571428571428572.\nStep3: Finally, 5 * -0.8571428571428572 = -4.2857142857142865, so this answer choice evaluates to -4.2857142857142865.\n\nSimilarly, we evaluate the expressions in B, C, and D in the same way as we evaluate the expression in A.\nFor B: using the precedence rule of choice B: '/' > '*' = '-', the expression 5 * 8 / 7 - 2 evaluates to 3.7142857142857135\nFor C: using the precedence rule of choice C: '*' = '/' > '-', the expression 5 * 8 / 7 - 2 evaluates to 3.7142857142857144\nFor D: using the precedence rule of choice D: '/' > '-' = '*', the expression 5 * 8 / 7 - 2 evaluates to 3.7142857142857135\nGiven above, only with choice C, the expression evaluates to 3.7142857142857144, so the correct answer should be [C]\n\nFor the expression 2 * 3 - 4 / 2, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

In this case, '*' comes before '-', so we calculate '*' first: 8 * 8 = 64, so the expression becomes 64 / 3 - 5.\nStep2: '-' has priority over '/'. Now we calculate '-': 3 - 5 = -2, so the expression becomes 64 / -2.\nStep3: Finally, 64 / -2 = -32.0, so this answer choice evaluates to -32.0.\n\nSimilarly, we evaluate the expressions in B, C, and D in the same way as we evaluate the expression in A.\nFor B: using the precedence rule of choice B: '*' > '/' = '-', the expression 8 * 8 / 3 - 5 evaluates to 16.333333333333332\nFor C: using the precedence rule of choice C: '/' = '-' > '*', the expression 8 * 8 / 3 - 5 evaluates to -18.666666666666668\nFor D: using the precedence rule of choice D: '-' > '/' > '*', the expression 8 * 8 / 3 - 5 evaluates to -32.0\nGiven above, only with choice B, the expression evaluates to 16.333333333333332, so the correct answer should be [B]\n\nFor the expression 9 / 3 - 2 * 7, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

This suggests that the subtraction should happen last, and the division and multiplication should result in a value close to 1. This means that the division by 7 and multiplication by 6 should cancel each other out. Therefore, the correct precedence should be that multiplication and division are performed before subtraction, and they should cancel each other out:\n\n3 / (7 - 4 * 6) = 3 / (7 - 24) = 3 / (-17) = -3 / 17 ≈ -0.17647058823529413\n\nThis is not the correct value either. It seems there is an error in the provided options and the expected result. The correct precedence that would give us the result 0.16666666666666666 is actually:\n\n(3 / 7) - (4 * 6) = 0.42857142857142855 - 24 = -23.571428571428573\n\nThis is not correct either. The expected result of 0.16666666666666666 is approximately equal to 1/6, which suggests that the operations should result in adding 1 to the product of 4 and 6, which is 24. This would mean that the subtraction operation should actually be an addition operation, which is not one of the options provided.\n\nIf we were to redefine the operators to achieve the expected result, we would need to consider an addition rather than a subtraction:\n\n3 / (7 - 4) * 6 = 3 / 3 * 6 = 1 * 6 = 6\n\nThis is still not correct. It seems there is no clear way to achieve the expected result of 0.16666666666666666 with the given expression and the provided options. There may be a mistake in the question or the expected result."

However, since the question specifies that the result should be exactly 0.0, we need to consider the order of operations within the choices. In choice A, the subtraction is performed first, which would not be possible if the result is to be 0.0, since the subtraction would have to result in a value that when multiplied by 5 would still be 0.0. Therefore, the correct answer must be [B], where the subtraction is performed last, allowing for the intermediate result to be 0.0 before the multiplication by 5, which does not change the result."

Let's try another approach:\n\nStep1: Perform the addition first: 7 + 3 = 10\nStep2: Perform the subtraction: 6 - 10 = -4\nStep3: Perform the division last: -4 / 6 = -0.6666666666666666\n\nThis also does not give us the correct result. It seems that we need to perform the division before the subtraction to get a fraction that can be subtracted from 6 to result in a number that is slightly greater than -1/9 when 3 is added.\n\nLet's try dividing before subtracting and adding last:\n\nStep1: Perform the division first: 7 / 6 = 1.1666666666666667\nStep2: Perform the subtraction: 6 - 1.1666666666666667 = 4.833333333333333\nStep3: Perform the addition last: 4.833333333333333 + 3 = 7.833333333333333\n\nThis also does not give us the correct result.

However, the question specifies that the expression 4 - 9 * 9 + 8 equals -37, which means that the correct precedence must be the one that follows the order of operations as they appear in the expression. Since option A suggests that '-' has a higher precedence than '+', which does not align with the order in the expression, it cannot be the correct answer. Option C suggests that '-' and '+' have the same precedence and are evaluated from left to right, which aligns with the order in the expression.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is [C]."

If we assume that the expression should be evaluated as (7 - 6) / (8 * 2) to get 0.0625, then the precedence would be:\nStep 1: Calculate 7 - 6 = 1\nStep 2: Calculate 8 * 2 = 16\nStep 3: Finally, calculate 1 / 16 = 0.0625\n\nThis would imply that subtraction has the highest precedence, followed by multiplication, and then division, which is not reflected in any of the given options.

'-' > '+' > '/'\n\n[Answer]: \nUsing the precedence rule in the correct answer choice, the expression 7 - 8 / 9 + 7 should evaluate to 6.888888888888889. We test four options one by one.\nFor A: The value of 7 - 8 / 9 + 7 can be calculated as follows:\nBased on the precedence rules of this answer choice '-' = '/' > '+', '-' and '/' have the same priority, which is higher than that of '+'\nStep1: Since '-' and '/' have the same priority over +, we evaluate '-' and '/' from left to right. In this case, '-' comes before '/', so we calculate '-' first: 7 - 8 = -1, so the expression becomes -1 / 9 + 7.\nStep2: '/' has priority over '+'. Now we calculate '/': -1 / 9 = -0.1111111111111111, so the expression becomes -0.1111111111111111 + 7.\nStep3: Finally, -0.1111111111111111 + 7 = 6.888888888888889, so this answer choice evaluates to 6.888888888888889.\n\nSimilarly, we evaluate the expressions in B, C, and D in the same way as we evaluate the expression in A.\nFor B: using the precedence rule of choice B: '/' = '+' > '-', the expression 7 - 8 / 9 + 7 evaluates to -0.8888888888888893\nFor C: using the precedence rule of choice C: '+' > '/' > '-', the expression 7 - 8 / 9 + 7 evaluates to 6.5\nFor D: using the precedence rule of choice D: '-' > '+' > '/', the expression 7 - 8 / 9 + 7 evaluates to -0.0625\nGiven above, only with choice A, the expression evaluates to 6.888888888888889, so the correct answer should be [A]\n\nFor the expression 2 - 6 + 5 / 8, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

However, if we consider the original expression and the result -1.125, we can deduce the correct precedence by working backward:\n\n2 - 6 + 5 / 8 = -1.125\nTo achieve -1.125, the subtraction must happen last, because 2 - 6 = -4, and we need to add a positive fraction to it to get a number slightly greater than -4. The addition of 5 / 8 would increase -4 to -3.375, which is the correct answer. Therefore, the correct precedence should be that '/' is evaluated first, '+' second, and '-' last. This is not represented in any of the given options A, B, C, or D.\n\nThe correct precedence that would result in -1.125 is '/' > '+' > '-'. Since this is not an option, it seems there might be an error in the question or the answer choices provided. If we strictly have to choose from the given options, none of them are correct. However, if we were to write a new option that reflects the correct precedence, it would be:\n\nE. '/' > '+' > '-'\n\nAnd the final answer would be [E], which is not listed in the original options."

Therefore, the correct answer must be the one that deviates from this standard.\n\nThe correct answer is [A], as it redefines the precedence by placing '+' and '-' above '/', which is different from the standard precedence rules."

'/' has the lowest priority.\nStep1: Since '*' has the highest priority, we calculate '*' first: 8 * 7 = 56, so the expression becomes 56 / 3 - 9.\nStep2: Since '-' has priority over '/', we then calculate '-': 3 - 9 = -6, so the expression becomes 56 / -6.\nStep3: Finally, 56 / -6 = -9.333333333333334, so this answer choice evaluates to -9.333333333333334.\n\nSimilarly, we evaluate the expressions in B, C, and D in the same way as we evaluate the expression in A.\nFor B: using the precedence rule of choice B: '*' = '/' = '-', the expression 8 * 7 / 3 - 9 evaluates to 9.666666666666668\nFor C: using the precedence rule of choice C: '/' > '-' > '*', the expression 8 * 7 / 3 - 9 evaluates to -53.33333333333333\nFor D: using the precedence rule of choice D: '-' > '/' > '*', the expression 8 * 7 / 3 - 9 evaluates to -9.333333333333334\nGiven above, only with choice B, the expression evaluates to 9.666666666666668, so the correct answer should be [B]\n\nFor the expression 1 / 1 * 5 - 1, the precedence of the operators is redefined.

However, this would not yield the result of 0.25.\n\nFor B: Using the precedence rule of choice B: '*' = '/' > '-', the expression 1 / 1 * 5 - 1 would be evaluated with multiplication and division first, then subtraction. This would result in (1 / 1) * 5 - 1 = 1 * 5 - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4, which is not equal to 0.25.\n\nFor C: Using the precedence rule of choice C: '-' > '*' > '/', the expression 1 / 1 * 5 - 1 would be evaluated with subtraction first, then multiplication, and finally division.
