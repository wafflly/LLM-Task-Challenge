Example: 'These cats in the park' is expressed as 'These P_cat in the park' to represent plural and 'A cat in the park' is expressed as 'A S_cat in the park' to represent singular
In Language A, the morphological rule for indicating tense involves adding '_-' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate past tense, and adding '_+' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate present tense in a sentence.
Example: 'The cat chased the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_- the dog' for past tense, and 'The cat chases the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_+ the dog' for present tense.
Here are the translated pairs of English lemmas into lemmas in language A: { (the, tgt_the), (pupil, tgt_pupil), (in, tgt_in), (the, tgt_the), (library, tgt_library), (read, tgt_read), (the, tgt_the), (thick, tgt_thick), (book, tgt_book), (slowly, tgt_slowly), (with, tgt_with), (great, tgt_great), (interest, tgt_interest), (., .) }.

Here are the translated pairs of English lemmas into lemmas in language A: { (the, tgt_the), (kind, tgt_kind), (girl, tgt_girl), (with, tgt_with), (a, tgt_a), (warm, tgt_warm), (heart, tgt_heart), (welcome, tgt_welcome), (her, tgt_her), (friend, tgt_friend), (happily, tgt_happily), (with, tgt_with), (her, tgt_her), (fresh, tgt_fresh), (salmon, tgt_salmon), (., .) }.
Translate the following simple sentence into Language A: "The kind girl with a warm heart welcomes her friend happily with her fresh salmon .".
Please put the final translated result in brackets [] at the end of your response, for example, [tgt_the tgt_cat tgt_the tgt_dog tgt_chases].
