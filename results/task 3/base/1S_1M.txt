Similarly,adverbs that modify a verb still maintain their position after the verb.
Prepositional phrases that modify a noun remain positioned after the noun.

In Language A, the morphological rule for nouns involves indicating a singular noun by adding 'S_' as a prefix to its lemma, and indicating a plural noun by adding 'P_' as a prefix to its lemma.
Example: 'These cats in the park' is expressed as 'These P_cat in the park' to represent plural and 'A cat in the park' is expressed as 'A S_cat in the park' to represent singular.
For anything not explicitly specified, Language A follows the same word order as English.

In Language A, a prepositional phrase modifying a verb is placed before the verb. If there is an adverb modifying the verb, the sentence follows the word order of prepositional phrase, adverb, and then the verb.
Example: 'The black cat drinks water slowly with its mouth' should be ordered as 'The black cat with its mouth slowly drinks water'.
Prepositional phrases that modify a noun remain positioned after the noun.

In Language A, the morphological rule for indicating tense involves adding '_-' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate past tense, and adding '_+' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate present tense in a sentence.
Example: 'The cat chased the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_- the dog' for past tense, and 'The cat chases the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_+ the dog' for present tense.
For anything not explicitly specified, Language A follows the same word order as English.

Example: 'These cats in the park' is expressed as 'These P_cat in the park' to represent plural and 'A cat in the park' is expressed as 'A S_cat in the park' to represent singular.
For anything not explicitly specified, Language A follows the same word order as English.

In Language A, the morphological rule for nouns involves indicating a singular noun by adding 'S_' as a prefix to its lemma, and indicating a plural noun by adding 'P_' as a prefix to its lemma.
Example: 'These cats in the park' is expressed as 'These P_cat in the park' to represent plural and 'A cat in the park' is expressed as 'A S_cat in the park' to represent singular.
For anything not explicitly specified, Language A follows the same word order as English.

Here are the translated pairs of English lemmas into lemmas in language A: { (warm, tgt_warm), (a, tgt_a), (dress, tgt_dress), (lady, tgt_lady), (kindly, tgt_kindly), (guest, tgt_guest), (her, tgt_her), (heart, tgt_heart), (green, tgt_green), (., .), (welcome, tgt_welcome), (in, tgt_in), (with, tgt_with), (distinguished, tgt_distinguished) }.
Translate the following simple sentence into Language A: "A lady in a green dress welcomed her distinguished guests kindly with a warm heart .".

In Language A, a prepositional phrase modifying a verb is placed before the verb. If there is an adverb modifying the verb, the sentence follows the word order of prepositional phrase, adverb, and then the verb.
Example: 'The black cat drinks water slowly with its mouth' should be ordered as 'The black cat with its mouth slowly drinks water'.
Prepositional phrases that modify a noun remain positioned after the noun.

In Language A, the morphological rule for indicating tense involves adding '_-' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate past tense, and adding '_+' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate present tense in a sentence.
Example: 'The cat chased the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_- the dog' for past tense, and 'The cat chases the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_+ the dog' for present tense.
For anything not explicitly specified, Language A follows the same word order as English.

Here are the translated pairs of English lemmas into lemmas in language A: { (the, tgt_the), (walk, tgt_walk), (mountain, tgt_mountain), (up, tgt_up), (., .), (hiker, tgt_hiker), (tirelessly, tgt_tirelessly), (determined, tgt_determined), (road, tgt_road), (backpack, tgt_backpack), (with, tgt_with) }.
Translate the following simple sentence into Language A: "The determined hikers with backpacks walks the road tirelessly up the mountain .".
Please put the final translated result in brackets [] at the end of your response, for example, [tgt_the tgt_cat tgt_the tgt_dog tgt_chases].

Prompts:  The following are the linguistic rules of Language A.
In Language A, the canonical word order of sentences follow a Subject-Object-Verb structure.
Example: 'The cat eats the mouse' should be ordered as 'The cat the mouse eats'.
Prepositional phrases that modify a verb remain positioned after the verb.
Similarly,adverbs that modify a verb still maintain their position after the verb.
Prepositional phrases that modify a noun remain positioned after the noun.

In Language A, the morphological rule for nouns involves indicating a singular noun by adding 'S_' as a prefix to its lemma, and indicating a plural noun by adding 'P_' as a prefix to its lemma.
Example: 'These cats in the park' is expressed as 'These P_cat in the park' to represent plural and 'A cat in the park' is expressed as 'A S_cat in the park' to represent singular.
For anything not explicitly specified, Language A follows the same word order as English.

source_sentence:  The talented girl with the rare violin plays the concerto passionately in front of the audience .
sentence_rules:  ['PP before verb']
morph_rules:  ['Tense']
random_pair:  (the, tgt_the), (talented, tgt_talented), (of, tgt_of), (girl, tgt_girl), (violin, tgt_violin), (play, tgt_play), (concerto, tgt_concerto), (front, tgt_front), (audience, tgt_audience), (., .), (passionately, tgt_passionately), (rare, tgt_rare), (in, tgt_in), (with, tgt_with)

Prompts:  The following are the linguistic rules of Language A.
In Language A, a prepositional phrase modifying a verb is placed before the verb. If there is an adverb modifying the verb, the sentence follows the word order of prepositional phrase, adverb, and then the verb.
Example: 'The black cat drinks water slowly with its mouth' should be ordered as 'The black cat with its mouth slowly drinks water'.
Prepositional phrases that modify a noun remain positioned after the noun.

In Language A, the morphological rule for indicating tense involves adding '_-' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate past tense, and adding '_+' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate present tense in a sentence.
Example: 'The cat chased the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_- the dog' for past tense, and 'The cat chases the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_+ the dog' for present tense.
For anything not explicitly specified, Language A follows the same word order as English.
