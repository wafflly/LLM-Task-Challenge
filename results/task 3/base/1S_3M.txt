Prompts:  The following are the linguistic rules of Language A.
In Language A, a prepositional phrase modifying a verb is placed before the verb. If there is an adverb modifying the verb, the sentence follows the word order of prepositional phrase, adverb, and then the verb.
Example: 'The black cat drinks water slowly with its mouth' should be ordered as 'The black cat with its mouth slowly drinks water'.
Prepositional phrases that modify a noun remain positioned after the noun.

In Language A, the morphological rule for nouns involves indicating a singular noun by adding 'S_' as a prefix to its lemma, and indicating a plural noun by adding 'P_' as a prefix to its lemma.
Example: 'These cats in the park' is expressed as 'These P_cat in the park' to represent plural and 'A cat in the park' is expressed as 'A S_cat in the park' to represent singular.
In Language A, the morphological rule for indicating tense involves adding '_-' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate past tense, and adding '_+' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate present tense in a sentence.
Example: 'The cat chased the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_- the dog' for past tense, and 'The cat chases the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_+ the dog' for present tense.
In Language A, each adjective is repeated twice consecutively in a sentence.
Example: 'The black dog chases the cat' is expressed as 'The black black dog chases the cat' with the adjective 'black' repeated twice.
For anything not explicitly specified, Language A follows the same word order as English.

Prepositional phrases that modify a verb remain positioned after the verb.
Similarly,adverbs that modify a verb still maintain their position after the verb.
In Language A, the morphological rule for nouns involves indicating a singular noun by adding 'S_' as a prefix to its lemma, and indicating a plural noun by adding 'P_' as a prefix to its lemma.
Example: 'These cats in the park' is expressed as 'These P_cat in the park' to represent plural and 'A cat in the park' is expressed as 'A S_cat in the park' to represent singular.
In Language A, the morphological rule for indicating tense involves adding '_-' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate past tense, and adding '_+' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate present tense in a sentence.
Example: 'The cat chased the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_- the dog' for past tense, and 'The cat chases the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_+ the dog' for present tense.
In Language A, each adjective is repeated twice consecutively in a sentence.
Example: 'The black dog chases the cat' is expressed as 'The black black dog chases the cat' with the adjective 'black' repeated twice.
For anything not explicitly specified, Language A follows the same word order as English.

Prompts:  The following are the linguistic rules of Language A.
In Language A, a prepositional phrase modifying a noun is placed before the noun. If there are determiners or adjectives modifying the noun, the sentence follows the word order of prepositional phrases, determiners, adjectives, and then the noun.
Example: 'The black cat in the park chases the dog' should be ordered as 'In the park the black cat chases the dog'.
Prepositional phrases that modify a verb remain positioned after the verb.
Similarly,adverbs that modify a verb still maintain their position after the verb.
In Language A, the morphological rule for nouns involves indicating a singular noun by adding 'S_' as a prefix to its lemma, and indicating a plural noun by adding 'P_' as a prefix to its lemma.
Example: 'These cats in the park' is expressed as 'These P_cat in the park' to represent plural and 'A cat in the park' is expressed as 'A S_cat in the park' to represent singular.
In Language A, the morphological rule for indicating tense involves adding '_-' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate past tense, and adding '_+' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate present tense in a sentence.
Example: 'The cat chased the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_- the dog' for past tense, and 'The cat chases the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_+ the dog' for present tense.
In Language A, each adjective is repeated twice consecutively in a sentence.
Example: 'The black dog chases the cat' is expressed as 'The black black dog chases the cat' with the adjective 'black' repeated twice.
For anything not explicitly specified, Language A follows the same word order as English.

Prompts:  The following are the linguistic rules of Language A.
In Language A, a prepositional phrase modifying a verb is placed before the verb. If there is an adverb modifying the verb, the sentence follows the word order of prepositional phrase, adverb, and then the verb.
Example: 'The black cat drinks water slowly with its mouth' should be ordered as 'The black cat with its mouth slowly drinks water'.
Prepositional phrases that modify a noun remain positioned after the noun.

In Language A, the morphological rule for nouns involves indicating a singular noun by adding 'S_' as a prefix to its lemma, and indicating a plural noun by adding 'P_' as a prefix to its lemma.
Example: 'These cats in the park' is expressed as 'These P_cat in the park' to represent plural and 'A cat in the park' is expressed as 'A S_cat in the park' to represent singular.
In Language A, the morphological rule for indicating tense involves adding '_-' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate past tense, and adding '_+' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate present tense in a sentence.
Example: 'The cat chased the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_- the dog' for past tense, and 'The cat chases the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_+ the dog' for present tense.
In Language A, each adjective is repeated twice consecutively in a sentence.
Example: 'The black dog chases the cat' is expressed as 'The black black dog chases the cat' with the adjective 'black' repeated twice.
For anything not explicitly specified, Language A follows the same word order as English.

Example: 'These cats in the park' is expressed as 'These P_cat in the park' to represent plural and 'A cat in the park' is expressed as 'A S_cat in the park' to represent singular.
In Language A, the morphological rule for indicating tense involves adding '_-' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate past tense, and adding '_+' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate present tense in a sentence.
Example: 'The cat chased the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_- the dog' for past tense, and 'The cat chases the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_+ the dog' for present tense.
In Language A, each adjective is repeated twice consecutively in a sentence.
Example: 'The black dog chases the cat' is expressed as 'The black black dog chases the cat' with the adjective 'black' repeated twice.
For anything not explicitly specified, Language A follows the same word order as English.

In Language A, a prepositional phrase modifying a noun is placed before the noun. If there are determiners or adjectives modifying the noun, the sentence follows the word order of prepositional phrases, determiners, adjectives, and then the noun.
Example: 'The black cat in the park chases the dog' should be ordered as 'In the park the black cat chases the dog'.
Prepositional phrases that modify a verb remain positioned after the verb.
Similarly,adverbs that modify a verb still maintain their position after the verb.
In Language A, the morphological rule for nouns involves indicating a singular noun by adding 'S_' as a prefix to its lemma, and indicating a plural noun by adding 'P_' as a prefix to its lemma.
Example: 'These cats in the park' is expressed as 'These P_cat in the park' to represent plural and 'A cat in the park' is expressed as 'A S_cat in the park' to represent singular.
In Language A, the morphological rule for indicating tense involves adding '_-' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate past tense, and adding '_+' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate present tense in a sentence.
Example: 'The cat chased the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_- the dog' for past tense, and 'The cat chases the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_+ the dog' for present tense.
In Language A, each adjective is repeated twice consecutively in a sentence.
Example: 'The black dog chases the cat' is expressed as 'The black black dog chases the cat' with the adjective 'black' repeated twice.
For anything not explicitly specified, Language A follows the same word order as English.

In Language A, the morphological rule for indicating tense involves adding '_-' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate past tense, and adding '_+' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate present tense in a sentence.
Example: 'The cat chased the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_- the dog' for past tense, and 'The cat chases the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_+ the dog' for present tense.
In Language A, each adjective is repeated twice consecutively in a sentence.
Example: 'The black dog chases the cat' is expressed as 'The black black dog chases the cat' with the adjective 'black' repeated twice.
For anything not explicitly specified, Language A follows the same word order as English.

Example: 'The black cat in the park chases the dog' should be ordered as 'In the park the black cat chases the dog'.
Prepositional phrases that modify a verb remain positioned after the verb.
Similarly,adverbs that modify a verb still maintain their position after the verb.
In Language A, the morphological rule for nouns involves indicating a singular noun by adding 'S_' as a prefix to its lemma, and indicating a plural noun by adding 'P_' as a prefix to its lemma.
Example: 'These cats in the park' is expressed as 'These P_cat in the park' to represent plural and 'A cat in the park' is expressed as 'A S_cat in the park' to represent singular.
In Language A, the morphological rule for indicating tense involves adding '_-' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate past tense, and adding '_+' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate present tense in a sentence.
Example: 'The cat chased the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_- the dog' for past tense, and 'The cat chases the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_+ the dog' for present tense.
In Language A, each adjective is repeated twice consecutively in a sentence.
Example: 'The black dog chases the cat' is expressed as 'The black black dog chases the cat' with the adjective 'black' repeated twice.
For anything not explicitly specified, Language A follows the same word order as English.

Prompts:  The following are the linguistic rules of Language A.
In Language A, a prepositional phrase modifying a verb is placed before the verb. If there is an adverb modifying the verb, the sentence follows the word order of prepositional phrase, adverb, and then the verb.
Example: 'The black cat drinks water slowly with its mouth' should be ordered as 'The black cat with its mouth slowly drinks water'.
Prepositional phrases that modify a noun remain positioned after the noun.

In Language A, the morphological rule for nouns involves indicating a singular noun by adding 'S_' as a prefix to its lemma, and indicating a plural noun by adding 'P_' as a prefix to its lemma.
Example: 'These cats in the park' is expressed as 'These P_cat in the park' to represent plural and 'A cat in the park' is expressed as 'A S_cat in the park' to represent singular.
In Language A, the morphological rule for indicating tense involves adding '_-' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate past tense, and adding '_+' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate present tense in a sentence.
Example: 'The cat chased the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_- the dog' for past tense, and 'The cat chases the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_+ the dog' for present tense.
In Language A, each adjective is repeated twice consecutively in a sentence.
Example: 'The black dog chases the cat' is expressed as 'The black black dog chases the cat' with the adjective 'black' repeated twice.
For anything not explicitly specified, Language A follows the same word order as English.

Prompts:  The following are the linguistic rules of Language A.
In Language A, a prepositional phrase modifying a verb is placed before the verb. If there is an adverb modifying the verb, the sentence follows the word order of prepositional phrase, adverb, and then the verb.
Example: 'The black cat drinks water slowly with its mouth' should be ordered as 'The black cat with its mouth slowly drinks water'.
Prepositional phrases that modify a noun remain positioned after the noun.

In Language A, the morphological rule for nouns involves indicating a singular noun by adding 'S_' as a prefix to its lemma, and indicating a plural noun by adding 'P_' as a prefix to its lemma.
Example: 'These cats in the park' is expressed as 'These P_cat in the park' to represent plural and 'A cat in the park' is expressed as 'A S_cat in the park' to represent singular.
In Language A, the morphological rule for indicating tense involves adding '_-' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate past tense, and adding '_+' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate present tense in a sentence.
Example: 'The cat chased the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_- the dog' for past tense, and 'The cat chases the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_+ the dog' for present tense.
In Language A, each adjective is repeated twice consecutively in a sentence.
Example: 'The black dog chases the cat' is expressed as 'The black black dog chases the cat' with the adjective 'black' repeated twice.
For anything not explicitly specified, Language A follows the same word order as English.

Example: 'These cats in the park' is expressed as 'These P_cat in the park' to represent plural and 'A cat in the park' is expressed as 'A S_cat in the park' to represent singular.
In Language A, the morphological rule for indicating tense involves adding '_-' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate past tense, and adding '_+' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate present tense in a sentence.
Example: 'The cat chased the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_- the dog' for past tense, and 'The cat chases the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_+ the dog' for present tense.
In Language A, each adjective is repeated twice consecutively in a sentence.
Example: 'The black dog chases the cat' is expressed as 'The black black dog chases the cat' with the adjective 'black' repeated twice.
For anything not explicitly specified, Language A follows the same word order as English.

Here are the translated pairs of English lemmas into lemmas in language A: { (room, tgt_room), (harshly, tgt_harshly), (sharp, tgt_sharp), (her, tgt_her), (angry, tgt_angry), (kid, tgt_kid), (tone, tgt_tone), (with, tgt_with), (a, tgt_a), (mom, tgt_mom), (the, tgt_the), (scold, tgt_scold), (., .), (in, tgt_in) }.
Translate the following simple sentence into Language A: "The angry mom in the room scolds her kid harshly with a sharp tone .".
Please put the final translated result in brackets [] at the end of your response, for example, [tgt_the tgt_cat tgt_the tgt_dog tgt_chases].
