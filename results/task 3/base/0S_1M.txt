Here are the translated pairs of English lemmas into lemmas in language A: { (the, tgt_the), (clever, tgt_clever), (detective, tgt_detective), (at, tgt_at), (the, tgt_the), (crime, tgt_crime), (scene, tgt_scene), (uncover, tgt_uncover), (the, tgt_the), (clue, tgt_clue), (meticulously, tgt_meticulously), (with, tgt_with), (keen, tgt_keen), (observation, tgt_observation), (., .) }.
Translate the following simple sentence into Language A: "The clever detective at the crime scene uncovers the clue meticulously with keen observation .".

Example: 'The cat chased the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_- the dog' for past tense, and 'The cat chases the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_+ the dog' for present tense.
Here are the translated pairs of English lemmas into lemmas in language A: { (the, tgt_the), (small, tgt_small), (seed, tgt_seed), (in, tgt_in), (the, tgt_the), (earth, tgt_earth), (sprout, tgt_sprout), (new, tgt_new), (life, tgt_life), (unexpectedly, tgt_unexpectedly), (with, tgt_with), (the, tgt_the), (promise, tgt_promise), (of, tgt_of), (a, tgt_a), (flower, tgt_flower), (., .) }.
Translate the following simple sentence into Language A: "The small seed in the earth sprouts new life unexpectedly with the promise of a flower .".
Please put the final translated result in brackets [] at the end of your response, for example, [tgt_the tgt_cat tgt_the tgt_dog tgt_chases].
