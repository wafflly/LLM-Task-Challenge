Adjectives are repeated twice consecutively.\n\nLet's break down the sentence:\n\n- \"The firefighter\" remains the same since it's a singular noun with a determiner and no adjectives or prepositional phrases modifying it. We apply the morphological rule for nouns: \"tgt_the S_tgt_firefighter\".\n- \"in the thick smoke\" is a prepositional phrase modifying the noun \"firefighter\". According to the rules, it should come before the noun. The adjective \"thick\" is repeated twice: \"tgt_in tgt_the tgt_thick tgt_thick tgt_smoke S_tgt_firefighter\".\n- \"rescues\" is the verb in present tense, so we add '_+': \"tgt_rescue_+\".\n- \"the trapped kitten\" is a singular noun with a determiner and an adjective. We apply the morphological rule for nouns and repeat the adjective: \"tgt_the tgt_trapped tgt_trapped S_tgt_kitten\".\n- \"bravely\" is an adverb modifying the verb \"rescues\" and remains after the verb: \"tgt_bravely\".\n- \"from the burning building\" is a prepositional phrase modifying the verb \"rescues\" and remains after the adverb. The adjective \"burning\" is repeated twice: \"tgt_from tgt_the tgt_burning tgt_burning tgt_building\".\n\nNow, let's put it all together following the rules of Language A:\n\n[tgt_in tgt_the tgt_thick tgt_thick tgt_smoke S_tgt_firefighter tgt_rescue_+ tgt_the tgt_trapped tgt_trapped S_tgt_kitten tgt_bravely tgt_from tgt_the tgt_burning tgt_burning tgt_building .]"

Object: \"the busy streets\"\n   - \"the\" translates to \"tgt_the\"\n   - \"busy\" is an adjective, so it's repeated twice: \"tgt_busy tgt_busy\"\n   - \"streets\" is a plural noun, so we add 'P_': \"P_tgt_street\"\n\n3. Verb: \"navigates\"\n   - Since it's present tense, we add '_+': \"tgt_navigate_+\"\n\n4. Adverb: \"smoothly\"\n   - \"smoothly\" remains after the verb: \"tgt_smoothly\"\n\n5. Prepositional phrase: \"in the city\"\n   - \"in\" translates to \"tgt_in\"\n   - \"the\" translates to \"tgt_the\"\n   - \"city\" is a singular noun, so we add 'S_': \"S_tgt_city\"\n\nNow, let's put it all together following the Subject-Object-Verb structure and the other rules:\n\n[tgt_the tgt_professional tgt_professional S_tgt_driver tgt_with tgt_a tgt_calm tgt_calm S_tgt_demeanor tgt_the tgt_busy tgt_busy P_tgt_street tgt_navigate_+ tgt_smoothly tgt_in tgt_the S_tgt_city .]\n\nSo the translated sentence in Language A is:\n\n[tgt_the tgt_professional tgt_professional S_tgt_driver tgt_with tgt_a tgt_calm tgt_calm S_tgt_demeanor tgt_the tgt_busy tgt_busy P_tgt_street tgt_navigate_+ tgt_smoothly tgt_in tgt_the S_tgt_city .]"

      "content": "First, let's break down the English sentence into its components and apply the rules of Language A step by step:\n\n1. Prepositional phrases modifying a noun are placed before the noun:\n   - \"at the popular cafe\" modifies \"workers\", so it goes before \"workers\".\n   - \"to the regular customers\" modifies \"served\", so it remains after the verb.\n\n2. Determiners and adjectives come before the noun they modify, and adjectives are repeated twice:\n   - \"the popular popular cafe\" modifies \"cafe\".\n   - \"the regular regular customers\" modifies \"customers\".\n\n3. Morphological rule for nouns (singular and plural):\n   - \"workers\" is plural, so it becomes \"P_worker\".\n   - \"customers\" is plural, so it becomes \"P_customer\".\n   - \"cafe\" is singular, so it becomes \"S_cafe\".\n\n4. Morphological rule for tense:\n   - \"served\" is past tense, so it becomes \"serve_-\" for the verb.\n\n5. Adverbs that modify a verb maintain their position after the verb:\n   - \"warmly\" remains after \"served\".\n\nNow, let's translate the sentence into Language A using the provided lemma translations:\n\n\"The workers at the popular cafe served the coffee warmly to the regular customers.\"\n\n- \"The\" translates to \"tgt_the\".\n- \"workers\" translates to \"tgt_worker\" and becomes \"P_tgt_worker\" for plural.\n- \"at\" translates to \"tgt_at\".\n- \"the\" remains \"tgt_the\".\n- \"popular\" translates to \"tgt_popular\" and is repeated twice.\n- \"cafe\" translates to \"tgt_cafe\" and becomes \"S_tgt_cafe\" for singular.\n- \"served\" translates to \"tgt_serve\" and becomes \"tgt_serve_-\" for past tense.\n- \"the\" remains \"tgt_the\".\n- \"coffee\" translates to \"tgt_coffee\".\n- \"warmly\" translates to \"tgt_warmly\".\n- \"to\" translates to \"tgt_to\".\n- \"the\" remains \"tgt_the\".\n- \"regular\" translates to \"tgt_regular\" and is repeated twice.\n- \"customers\" translates to \"tgt_customer\" and becomes \"P_tgt_customer\" for plural.\n- The period \".\" remains \".\".\n\nPutting it all together following the rules of Language A:\n\n[tgt_at tgt_the tgt_popular tgt_popular S_tgt_cafe tgt_the P_tgt_worker tgt_serve_- tgt_the tgt_coffee tgt_warmly tgt_to tgt_the tgt_regular tgt_regular P_tgt_customer .]\n\nThis is the sentence in Language A."

According to the rules, these come before the verb. \"quickly\" and \"great\" are translated to \"tgt_quickly\" and \"tgt_great\", respectively, and \"interest\" remains \"tgt_interest\". \"with\" is translated to \"tgt_with\".\n\nNow, let's put it all together following the rules:\n\n\"The kid with a cute cute smile reads the thick thick book quickly with great great interest.\" becomes:\n\n\"The S_tgt_kid with tgt_a tgt_cute tgt_cute smile tgt_with tgt_great tgt_great tgt_interest tgt_quickly read_+ the tgt_the tgt_thick tgt_thick S_tgt_book.\"\n\nIn brackets, the final translated result is:\n\n[tgt_the S_tgt_kid with tgt_a tgt_cute tgt_cute smile tgt_with tgt_great tgt_great tgt_interest tgt_quickly read_+ tgt_the tgt_thick tgt_thick S_tgt_book .]"

Prepositional phrases that modify a verb are positioned after the verb: \"slowly into the vase\" modifies the verb \"puts\", so it will come after the verb.\n\n3. Prepositional phrases that modify a noun are positioned after the noun: \"in the lush garden\" modifies the noun \"man\", so it will come after \"man\".\n\n4. Singular and plural nouns are indicated with 'S_' and 'P_': \"man\" and \"vase\" are singular, so they will be \"S_man\" and \"S_vase\". \"flowers\" is plural, so it will be \"P_flower\".\n\n5. Tense is indicated with '_-' for past and '_+' for present: \"puts\" is present tense, so it will be \"tgt_put_+\".\n\n6. Adjectives are repeated twice consecutively: \"retired\" and \"lush\" are adjectives, so they will be \"tgt_retired tgt_retired\" and \"tgt_lush tgt_lush\". \"fragrant\" is also an adjective, so it will be \"tgt_fragrant tgt_fragrant\".\n\n7. Translate the lemmas using the provided pairs: We will replace the English lemmas with their corresponding lemmas in Language A.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to the sentence:\n\n- \"The retired man in the lush garden puts the fragrant flowers slowly into the vase.\" becomes:\n- \"The retired retired man in the lush lush garden puts the fragrant fragrant flowers slowly into the vase.\" (adjectives repeated)\n- \"tgt_the tgt_retired tgt_retired S_man tgt_in tgt_the tgt_lush tgt_lush tgt_garden tgt_put_+ tgt_the tgt_fragrant tgt_fragrant P_flower tgt_slowly tgt_into tgt_the S_vase.\" (translated and reordered according to the rules)\n\nPutting it all together, we get the final translated sentence in Language A:\n\n[tgt_the tgt_retired tgt_retired S_man tgt_in tgt_the tgt_lush tgt_lush tgt_garden tgt_put_+ tgt_the tgt_fragrant tgt_fragrant P_flower tgt_slowly tgt_into tgt_the S_vase .]"

Since \"lawyer\" is singular, we use 'S_' before \"lawyer\". The adjective \"successful\" is repeated twice.\n- \"defends the case\" has the present tense verb \"defends\", so we add '_+' to \"defend\". \"case\" is singular, so we use 'S_' before \"case\".\n- \"convincingly with solid evidence\" has the adverb \"convincingly\" and the prepositional phrase \"with solid evidence\". The adjective \"solid\" is repeated twice.\n\nNow, let's translate each part:\n\n- \"The successful lawyer in the courtroom\" becomes \"In tgt_courtroom tgt_the tgt_successful tgt_successful S_tgt_lawyer\".\n- \"defends the case\" becomes \"defend_+ tgt_the S_tgt_case\".\n- \"convincingly with solid evidence\" becomes \"tgt_convincingly with tgt_solid tgt_solid S_tgt_evidence\".\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\"In tgt_courtroom tgt_the tgt_successful tgt_successful S_tgt_lawyer defend_+ tgt_the S_tgt_case tgt_convincingly with tgt_solid tgt_solid S_tgt_evidence.\"\n\nTherefore, the translated sentence in Language A is:\n\n[in tgt_courtroom tgt_the tgt_successful tgt_successful S_tgt_lawyer defend_+ tgt_the S_tgt_case tgt_convincingly with tgt_solid tgt_solid S_tgt_evidence .]"

Prepositional phrases that modify a verb remain positioned after the verb.\n4. Adverbs that modify a verb maintain their position after the verb.\n5.

Past tense is indicated by adding '_-' as a suffix to the verb, and present tense by adding '_+'.\n7. Each adjective is repeated twice consecutively.\n\nLet's break down the sentence:\n\n- \"The brown sands on the ground\" follows the order of prepositional phrase, determiner, adjective, and noun. Since \"sands\" is plural, we use 'P_' before \"sand\". The adjective \"brown\" is repeated twice.\n- \"create\" is the verb in present tense, so we add '_+'.\n- \"a carpet\" has a determiner and a singular noun, so we use 'S_' before \"carpet\".\n- \"beautifully on the ground\" is an adverb modifying the verb \"create\" and a prepositional phrase. Both remain after the verb.\n\nNow, let's apply the lemma translations:\n\n- \"The\" translates to \"tgt_the\".\n- \"brown\" translates to \"tgt_brown\".\n- \"sands\" translates to \"P_tgt_sand\".\n- \"on\" translates to \"tgt_on\".\n- \"the ground\" remains \"the ground\" as \"ground\" is not in the lemma list.\n- \"create\" translates to \"tgt_create\".\n- \"a\" translates to \"tgt_a\".\n- \"carpet\" translates to \"S_tgt_carpet\".\n- \"beautifully\" translates to \"tgt_beautifully\".\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n\"The brown sands on the ground create a carpet beautifully on the ground.\" becomes \"tgt_on the ground tgt_the tgt_brown tgt_brown P_tgt_sand tgt_create_+ tgt_a S_tgt_carpet tgt_beautifully tgt_on the ground.\"\n\nEnclosed in brackets, the final translated result is:\n\n[tgt_on the ground tgt_the tgt_brown tgt_brown P_tgt_sand tgt_create_+ tgt_a S_tgt_carpet tgt_beautifully tgt_on the ground .]"

According to the rules, the adjective \"strong\" should be repeated twice. The noun \"wind\" is singular, so we add 'S_' as a prefix.\n- \"from the north\" is a prepositional phrase modifying the noun \"wind,\" so it should come before the noun.\n- \"sweeps\" is the verb in present tense, so we add '_+' as a suffix.\n- \"the city\" is a noun phrase with a determiner and a singular noun, so we add 'S_' as a prefix to \"city.\"\n- \"entirely\" is an adverb modifying the verb \"sweeps,\" so it remains after the verb.\n- \"with freeze\" is a prepositional phrase modifying the verb \"sweeps,\" so it remains after the verb and the adverb.\n\nNow, let's apply the lemma translations:\n\n- city -> tgt_city\n- north -> tgt_north\n- with -> tgt_with\n- freeze -> tgt_freeze\n- the -> tgt_the\n- from -> tgt_from\n- strong -> tgt_strong\n- wind -> tgt_wind\n- sweeps -> tgt_sweep\n- entirely -> tgt_entirely\n\nApplying the rules and translations, we get:\n\n\"The strong strong wind from the north\" -> \"tgt_from tgt_north tgt_the tgt_strong tgt_strong S_tgt_wind\"\n\"sweeps\" -> \"tgt_sweep_+\"\n\"the city\" -> \"tgt_the S_tgt_city\"\n\"entirely\" -> \"tgt_entirely\"\n\"with freeze\" -> \"tgt_with tgt_freeze\"\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n[tgt_from tgt_north tgt_the tgt_strong tgt_strong S_tgt_wind tgt_sweep_+ tgt_the S_tgt_city tgt_entirely tgt_with tgt_freeze .]"

Past tense is indicated by adding '_-' as a suffix to the verb, and present tense by adding '_+'.\n6. Each adjective is repeated twice consecutively.\n\nLet's break down the sentence:\n\n- \"The promising rain from the sky\" follows the order of prepositional phrase, determiner, adjective, and noun. Since \"rain\" is singular, we use 'S_' and since \"promising\" is an adjective, we repeat it twice.\n- \"revives the land\" has the present tense verb \"revives\" and the singular noun \"land\", so we add 'S_' to \"land\" and '_+' to \"revive\".\n- \"mercifully with its raindrops\" has the adverb \"mercifully\" modifying the verb, which stays after the verb. The prepositional phrase \"with its raindrops\" follows the verb. \"Raindrops\" is plural, so we use 'P_'.\n\nNow, let's translate each part:\n\n- \"The promising rain from the sky\" becomes \"From tgt_from the tgt_the tgt_promising tgt_promising S_tgt_rain\".\n- \"revives the land\" becomes \"tgt_revive_+ the tgt_the S_tgt_land\".\n- \"mercifully with its raindrops\" becomes \"tgt_mercifully with tgt_with its tgt_its P_tgt_raindrop\".\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n[From tgt_from the tgt_the tgt_promising tgt_promising S_tgt_rain tgt_revive_+ the tgt_the S_tgt_land tgt_mercifully with tgt_with its tgt_its P_tgt_raindrop .]"

Prepositional phrases modifying a verb are placed before the verb.\n2. If there is an adverb modifying the verb, the order is prepositional phrase, adverb, then verb.\n3. Prepositional phrases modifying a noun are placed after the noun.\n4. Singular nouns are prefixed with 'S_', and plural nouns with 'P_'.\n5. Tense is indicated by adding '_-' for past and '_+' for present to the verb lemma.\n6. Adjectives are repeated twice consecutively.\n7. The word order follows English unless specified otherwise.\n\nLet's break down the sentence:\n\n- \"The talented girl\" becomes \"tgt_the tgt_talented tgt_talented S_tgt_girl\"\n- \"with the rare violin\" (modifying the noun \"girl\") remains after the noun, becoming \"tgt_with tgt_the tgt_rare tgt_rare S_tgt_violin\"\n- \"plays\" in present tense becomes \"tgt_play_+\"\n- \"the concerto\" becomes \"tgt_the S_tgt_concerto\"\n- \"passionately\" remains \"tgt_passionately\"\n- \"in front of the audience\" is a prepositional phrase modifying the verb \"plays\" and thus comes before the adverb and verb, becoming \"tgt_in tgt_front tgt_of tgt_the P_tgt_audience\"\n\nNow, let's put it all together following the rules:\n\n\"The talented talented girl with the rare rare violin in front of the audience passionately plays the concerto.\"\n\nTranslated into Language A:\n\n[tgt_the tgt_talented tgt_talented S_tgt_girl tgt_with tgt_the tgt_rare tgt_rare S_tgt_violin tgt_in tgt_front tgt_of tgt_the P_tgt_audience tgt_passionately tgt_play_+ tgt_the S_tgt_concerto .]"
