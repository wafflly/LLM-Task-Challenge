For anything not explicitly specified, Language A follows the same word order as English.\n\nLet's break down the sentence:\n\n- \"The boy with a smile\" follows the rule for prepositional phrases modifying a noun, so \"with a smile\" comes before \"the boy\". Also, \"boy\" is singular, so we use 'S_' as a prefix.\n- \"Feeds\" is in the present tense, so we add '_+' as a suffix.\n- \"The hungry cat\" has an adjective \"hungry\" which should be repeated twice, and \"cat\" is singular, so we use 'S_' as a prefix.\n- \"Happily with a spoon\" modifies the verb \"feeds\", so \"with a spoon\" comes first, followed by \"happily\", and then the verb.\n\nNow, let's apply the lemma translations:\n\n- \"The\" translates to \"tgt_the\".\n- \"Boy\" translates to \"tgt_boy\", with the singular prefix it becomes \"S_tgt_boy\".\n- \"With\" translates to \"tgt_with\".\n- \"A\" translates to \"tgt_a\".\n- \"Smile\" remains \"smile\" (no translation provided, so we assume it's the same in Language A).\n- \"Feeds\" translates to \"tgt_feed\", with the present tense suffix it becomes \"tgt_feed_+\".\n- \"The\" translates to \"tgt_the\".\n- \"Hungry\" translates to \"tgt_hungry\", and it's repeated twice.\n- \"Cat\" translates to \"tgt_cat\", with the singular prefix it becomes \"S_tgt_cat\".\n- \"Happily\" translates to \"tgt_happily\".\n- \"With\" translates to \"tgt_with\".\n- \"Spoon\" translates to \"tgt_spoon\".\n- The period \".\" remains the same.\n\nPutting it all together following the rules:\n\n[tgt_the S_tgt_boy tgt_with tgt_a smile tgt_with tgt_a tgt_spoon tgt_happily tgt_feed_+ tgt_the tgt_hungry tgt_hungry S_tgt_cat .]"

The verb \"calculates\" is in the present tense, so we add '_+'. The adjective \"annual\" is repeated twice before the noun \"budget\".\n- \"accurately with software\" follows the rule for prepositional phrases and adverbs modifying a verb. The prepositional phrase \"with software\" comes before the adverb \"accurately\", which in turn comes before the verb.\n\nNow, let's apply the translations for the lemmas:\n\n- efficient -> tgt_efficient\n- with -> tgt_with\n- at -> tgt_at\n- . -> .\n- annual -> tgt_annual\n- the -> tgt_the\n- calculate -> tgt_calculate\n- accountant -> tgt_accountant\n- software -> tgt_software\n- budget -> tgt_budget\n- firm -> tgt_firm\n- accurately -> tgt_accurately\n\nThe translated sentence in Language A, following the rules and lemma translations, is:\n\n[tgt_at tgt_the tgt_firm tgt_the tgt_efficient tgt_efficient tgt_accountant tgt_with tgt_software tgt_accurately tgt_calculate_+ tgt_the tgt_annual tgt_annual tgt_budget .]"

Each adjective is repeated twice consecutively:\n   \"Green\" becomes \"tgt_green tgt_green\" and \"warm\" becomes \"tgt_warm tgt_warm\". \"Distinguished\" is also an adjective, so it becomes \"tgt_distinguished tgt_distinguished\".\n\n7. Translate the lemmas:\n   \"A\" becomes \"tgt_a\", \"in\" becomes \"tgt_in\", \"with\" becomes \"tgt_with\", \"her\" becomes \"tgt_her\", \"kindly\" becomes \"tgt_kindly\", and the period remains the same.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence in Language A should be:\n\"A S_lady in a tgt_green tgt_green dress tgt_her tgt_distinguished tgt_distinguished P_guest tgt_with tgt_a tgt_warm tgt_warm heart tgt_kindly welcome_-.\"\n\nNow, let's replace the English words with their corresponding lemmas in Language A:\n\"tgt_a S_lady tgt_in tgt_a tgt_green tgt_green tgt_dress tgt_her tgt_distinguished tgt_distinguished P_guest tgt_with tgt_a tgt_warm tgt_warm heart tgt_kindly welcome_-.\"\n\nThe final translated result is:\n[tgt_a S_lady tgt_in tgt_a tgt_green tgt_green tgt_dress tgt_her tgt_distinguished tgt_distinguished P_guest tgt_with tgt_a tgt_warm tgt_warm heart tgt_kindly welcome_- .]"

Past tense is indicated by adding '_-' as a suffix to the verb, and present tense by adding '_+'.\n7. Each adjective is repeated twice consecutively.\n8. We will use the provided lemma translations for the specific words.\n\nLet's break down the sentence:\n\n- \"The clever detective\" follows the rule for determiners and adjectives, so it becomes \"tgt_the tgt_clever tgt_clever tgt_detective\".\n- \"with a keen eye\" is a prepositional phrase modifying the noun \"detective\", so it should come before the noun. \"a keen eye\" becomes \"tgt_a tgt_keen tgt_keen tgt_eye\", and with the preposition \"with\" it becomes \"tgt_with tgt_a tgt_keen tgt_keen tgt_eye\".\n- \"solves\" is the present tense verb, so it becomes \"tgt_solve_+\".\n- \"the mysterious case\" follows the rule for determiners and adjectives, so it becomes \"tgt_the tgt_mysterious tgt_mysterious tgt_case\".\n- \"logically\" is an adverb modifying the verb, so it comes before the verb.\n- \"through careful investigation\" is a prepositional phrase modifying the verb, so it comes before the adverb. \"careful investigation\" becomes \"tgt_careful tgt_careful tgt_investigation\", and with the preposition \"through\" it becomes \"tgt_through tgt_careful tgt_careful tgt_investigation\".\n\nNow, let's put it all together following the rules of Language A:\n\n\"The clever detective with a keen eye\" -> \"tgt_with tgt_a tgt_keen tgt_keen tgt_eye tgt_the tgt_clever tgt_clever tgt_detective\"\n\"solves\" -> \"tgt_solve_+\"\n\"the mysterious case\" -> \"tgt_the tgt_mysterious tgt_mysterious tgt_case\"\n\"logically through careful investigation\" -> \"tgt_through tgt_careful tgt_careful tgt_investigation tgt_logically\"\n\nCombining all parts in the correct order, we get:\n\n[tgt_with tgt_a tgt_keen tgt_keen tgt_eye tgt_the tgt_clever tgt_clever tgt_detective tgt_through tgt_careful tgt_careful tgt_investigation tgt_logically tgt_solve_+ tgt_the tgt_mysterious tgt_mysterious tgt_case .]"

      "content": "To translate the sentence \"The clever detective at the crime scene uncovers the clue meticulously with keen observation.\" into Language A, we need to follow the linguistic rules provided.\n\nFirst, let's identify the parts of the sentence:\n- Subject: The clever detective\n- Prepositional phrase modifying the noun (detective): at the crime scene\n- Verb: uncovers\n- Object: the clue\n- Adverb modifying the verb: meticulously\n- Prepositional phrase modifying the verb: with keen observation\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of Language A to translate the sentence:\n\n1. The canonical word order in Language A is Subject-Object-Verb, so we'll maintain the subject \"The clever detective\" at the beginning and place the verb \"uncovers\" at the end.\n\n2. Prepositional phrases that modify a noun remain positioned after the noun. So \"at the crime scene\" will follow \"The clever detective\".\n\n3. Prepositional phrases modifying a verb are placed before the verb, and if there is an adverb modifying the verb, the order is prepositional phrase, adverb, then verb. So \"with keen observation meticulously\" will precede \"uncovers\".\n\n4. Singular nouns are indicated by adding 'S_' as a prefix to their lemma, and plural nouns by adding 'P_' as a prefix. Since \"detective\" and \"clue\" are singular, we will prefix them with 'S_'.\n\n5. The morphological rule for tense indicates that we add '_-' for past tense and '_+' for present tense to the verb. Since \"uncovers\" is present tense, we will add '_+' to the lemma of the verb.\n\n6. Each adjective is repeated twice consecutively. So \"clever\" becomes \"clever clever\" and \"keen\" becomes \"keen keen\".\n\n7. Finally, we replace the English lemmas with the corresponding lemmas in Language A.\n\nApplying these rules, we get the following translation:\n\n- The clever clever detective at the crime scene -> tgt_the tgt_clever tgt_clever S_tgt_detective tgt_at tgt_the S_tgt_crime tgt_scene\n- uncovers the clue -> tgt_uncover_+ tgt_the S_tgt_clue\n- meticulously with keen observation -> tgt_meticulously tgt_with tgt_keen tgt_keen tgt_observation\n\nPutting it all together in the Subject-Object-Verb structure with the prepositional phrase and adverb in the correct order:\n\n[tgt_the tgt_clever tgt_clever S_tgt_detective tgt_at tgt_the S_tgt_crime tgt_scene tgt_with tgt_keen tgt_keen tgt_observation tgt_meticulously tgt_uncover_+ tgt_the S_tgt_clue .]"
