The canonical word order in Language A is Subject-Object-Verb, so we'll maintain the subject \"The curious child\" at the beginning, the object \"the ancient castle\" in the middle, and the verb \"explores\" at the end.\n\n2. Prepositional phrases modifying a verb are placed before the verb. In this sentence, we have two prepositional phrases modifying the verb \"explores\": \"with sparkling eyes\" and \"during the trip\". According to the rules, we place these before the verb and the adverb \"eagerly\".\n\n3. The adverb \"eagerly\" modifies the verb \"explores\" and should be placed just before the verb.\n\n4. Prepositional phrases modifying a noun are placed before the noun. In this case, \"with sparkling eyes\" modifies \"child\" and should be placed before it. However, since \"with sparkling eyes\" also functions as a prepositional phrase modifying the verb \"explores\", we will consider it as modifying the verb for the purpose of this sentence structure.\n\n5. Morphological rule for nouns: \"child\" is singular, so we add 'S_' as a prefix to its lemma. \"castle\" is also singular, so we add 'S_' as a prefix to its lemma.\n\n6. Each adjective is repeated twice consecutively. \"curious\" and \"ancient\" are the adjectives, so we repeat them twice.\n\nNow, let's apply the translations provided:\n\n- child -> tgt_child\n- curious -> tgt_curious\n- castle -> tgt_castle\n- eagerly -> tgt_eagerly\n- sparkle -> tgt_sparkle\n- the -> tgt_the\n- explore -> tgt_explore\n- trip -> tgt_trip\n- with -> tgt_with\n- during -> tgt_during\n- ancient -> tgt_ancient\n- eye -> tgt_eye\n\nThe sentence \"The curious child with sparkling eyes explores the ancient castle eagerly during the trip.\" will be translated into Language A as follows:\n\n\"The curious curious child with sparkling sparkling eyes explores the ancient ancient castle eagerly during the trip.\" becomes:\n\n\"tgt_the tgt_curious tgt_curious S_tgt_child tgt_with tgt_sparkle tgt_sparkle tgt_eye tgt_during tgt_trip tgt_eagerly tgt_explore tgt_the tgt_ancient tgt_ancient S_tgt_castle .\"\n\nPutting it all together in brackets as requested:\n\n[tgt_the tgt_curious tgt_curious S_tgt_child tgt_with tgt_sparkle tgt_sparkle tgt_eye tgt_during tgt_trip tgt_eagerly tgt_explore tgt_the tgt_ancient tgt_ancient S_tgt_castle .]"

Subject-Object-Verb structure: The subject is \"The professional driver in the sleek car,\" the object is \"the busy street,\" and the verb is \"navigates.\"\n\n2. Prepositional phrases modifying a verb are placed before the verb, and if there is an adverb modifying the verb, the order is prepositional phrase, adverb, then verb.\n\n3. Prepositional phrases modifying a noun are placed before the noun, and if there are determiners or adjectives, the order is prepositional phrases, determiners, adjectives, then noun.\n\n4. Singular nouns are indicated with 'S_' as a prefix, and plural nouns with 'P_' as a prefix.\n\n5. Tense is indicated by adding '_-' for past tense and '_+' for present tense to the verb lemma.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules step by step:\n\n- The subject noun phrase \"The professional driver in the sleek car\" follows the order of prepositional phrase, determiner, adjective, noun. So, it becomes \"In the sleek car the professional driver.\"\n- The object noun phrase \"the busy street\" follows the order of determiner, adjective, noun. So, it remains \"the busy street.\"\n- The verb \"navigates\" is in the present tense, so we add '_+' to the lemma: \"tgt_navigate_+.\"\n- The adverb \"smoothly\" follows the prepositional phrase \"during rush hour\" before the verb. So, it becomes \"during rush hour smoothly navigates.\"\n\nNow, we translate each word using the provided lemma pairs and apply the morphological rules for nouns and verbs:\n\n- \"The\" translates to \"tgt_the.\"\n- \"Professional\" translates to \"tgt_professional.\"\n- \"Driver\" is a singular noun, so we add 'S_' to the lemma: \"S_tgt_driver.\"\n- \"In\" translates to \"tgt_in.\"\n- \"Sleek\" translates to \"tgt_sleek.\"\n- \"Car\" is a singular noun, so we add 'S_' to the lemma: \"S_tgt_car.\"\n- \"Navigates\" translates to \"tgt_navigate_+.\"\n- \"The\" translates to \"tgt_the.\"\n- \"Busy\" translates to \"tgt_busy.\"\n- \"Street\" is a singular noun, so we add 'S_' to the lemma: \"S_tgt_street.\"\n- \"Smoothly\" translates to \"tgt_smoothly.\"\n- \"During\" translates to \"tgt_during.\"\n- \"Rush\" translates to \"tgt_rush.\"\n- \"Hour\" is a singular noun, so we add 'S_' to the lemma: \"S_tgt_hour.\"\n\nPutting it all together in the correct order for Language A:\n\n[tgt_in tgt_the tgt_sleek S_tgt_car tgt_the tgt_professional S_tgt_driver tgt_during tgt_the tgt_busy S_tgt_street tgt_tgt_smoothly tgt_navigate_+ tgt_the tgt_rush S_tgt_hour .]\n\nAnd finally, we remove the extra 'tgt_' from \"tgt_tgt_smoothly\" to correct the typo:\n\n[tgt_in tgt_the tgt_sleek S_tgt_car tgt_the tgt_professional S_tgt_driver tgt_during tgt_the tgt_busy S_tgt_street tgt_smoothly tgt_navigate_+ tgt_the tgt_rush S_tgt_hour .]"

Prepositional phrases modifying a verb are placed before the verb, followed by any adverbs, and then the verb. The phrase \"with its legs\" modifies \"collects\", and \"tirelessly\" is an adverb modifying \"collects\", so the order will be \"with its legs tirelessly collects\".\n\n4.

      "content": "First, let's translate each word in the sentence using the provided lemma pairs:\n\n- The skilled musicians on the grand stage = tgt_the tgt_skilled P_tgt_musician tgt_on tgt_the tgt_grand tgt_stage\n- perform = tgt_perform\n- the classic pieces = tgt_the tgt_classic P_tgt_piece\n- passionately = tgt_passionately\n- with their fine instruments = tgt_with tgt_their tgt_fine P_tgt_instrument\n\nNow, let's apply the linguistic rules of Language A to the sentence:\n\n1. The canonical word order is Subject-Object-Verb, so we start with the subject phrase \"The skilled musicians on the grand stage\", then the object phrase \"the classic pieces\", and finally the verb \"perform\".\n\n2. Prepositional phrases modifying a noun are placed before the noun. In the subject phrase, \"on the grand stage\" modifies \"musicians\", so it comes before \"tgt_skilled P_tgt_musician\". In the object phrase, there are no prepositional phrases modifying the noun.\n\n3. Prepositional phrases modifying a verb are placed before the verb, followed by any adverbs, and then the verb. In this case, \"with their fine instruments\" modifies the verb \"perform\", and \"passionately\" is the adverb modifying the verb. So, we place \"with their fine instruments\" before \"passionately\", followed by \"perform\".\n\n4. The morphological rule for nouns indicates that we should add 'S_' for singular nouns and 'P_' for plural nouns. In this sentence, \"musicians\" and \"pieces\" are plural, so we add 'P_' before \"tgt_musician\" and \"tgt_piece\".\n\n5. The morphological rule for tense is not applicable here because the sentence is in the present tense and we don't have the present tense marker provided. We will assume that the base form \"tgt_perform\" is already in the present tense.\n\n6. For anything not specified, we follow the same word order as English.\n\nApplying these rules, we get the following sentence structure in Language A:\n\n[tgt_on tgt_the tgt_grand tgt_the tgt_skilled P_tgt_musician tgt_the tgt_classic P_tgt_piece tgt_with tgt_their tgt_fine P_tgt_instrument tgt_passionately tgt_perform]\n\nPutting it all together in brackets as requested:\n\n[tgt_on tgt_the tgt_grand tgt_the tgt_skilled P_tgt_musician tgt_the tgt_classic P_tgt_piece tgt_with tgt_their tgt_fine P_tgt_instrument tgt_passionately tgt_perform_+]"

Prepositional phrases modifying a noun are placed before the noun, followed by determiners, adjectives, and then the noun.\n4. Tense is indicated by adding '_-' for past tense and '_+' for present tense to the verb lemma.\n5. Each adjective is repeated twice consecutively.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to the sentence \"The professional golfer on the green course hits the ball powerfully with a perfect swing.\"\n\n- \"The professional golfer\" is the subject. According to the rules, we place the prepositional phrase \"on the green course\" before the noun \"golfer,\" and we repeat the adjective \"professional\" twice.\n- \"The ball\" is the object, and it follows the subject directly.\n- \"Hits\" is the verb, and it's in the present tense, so we add '_+' to indicate this.\n- The prepositional phrase \"with a perfect swing\" modifies the verb \"hits,\" and we place it before the verb. The adjective \"perfect\" is repeated twice, and it comes before the noun \"swing.\"\n\nNow, let's translate each word using the provided lemma pairs and apply the rules:\n\n\"The professional golfer on the green course\" becomes \"tgt_on tgt_the tgt_green tgt_green tgt_course tgt_the tgt_professional tgt_professional tgt_golfer\".\n\"Hits the ball powerfully with a perfect swing\" becomes \"tgt_with tgt_a tgt_perfect tgt_perfect tgt_swing tgt_powerfully hit_+ tgt_the tgt_ball\".\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n[tgt_on tgt_the tgt_green tgt_green tgt_course tgt_the tgt_professional tgt_professional tgt_golfer hit_+ tgt_the tgt_ball tgt_with tgt_a tgt_perfect tgt_perfect tgt_swing tgt_powerfully].\n\nHowever, we need to ensure the word order follows the Subject-Object-Verb structure, with the prepositional phrase and adverb before the verb.

The canonical word order is Subject-Object-Verb.\n2. A prepositional phrase modifying a verb is placed before the verb.\n3. If there is an adverb modifying the verb, the sentence follows the word order of prepositional phrase, adverb, and then the verb.\n4. A prepositional phrase modifying a noun is placed before the noun.\n5. Singular and plural nouns are indicated with 'S_' and 'P_' prefixes, respectively.\n6. Tense is indicated with '_-' for past and '_+' for present.\n\nLet's translate the sentence step by step:\n\n- \"The watchful ranger in the national park\" becomes \"In the national park the watchful ranger\" (applying rule 4).\n- \"protects\" is present tense, so we add '_+' to the lemma 'tgt_protect' to get 'tgt_protect_+'.\n- \"the wildlife\" remains the same as it's a singular noun and doesn't need a prefix.\n- \"vigilantly with a deep commitment to conservation\" is a prepositional phrase followed by an adverb modifying the verb, so it comes before the verb and follows the order of prepositional phrase, adverb, verb.\n\nNow, let's replace the English lemmas with the lemmas in Language A:\n\n- \"The watchful ranger\" becomes \"tgt_the tgt_watchful tgt_ranger\"\n- \"in the national park\" becomes \"tgt_in tgt_the tgt_national tgt_park\"\n- \"protects\" becomes \"tgt_protect_+\"\n- \"the wildlife\" becomes \"tgt_the S_wildlife\"\n- \"vigilantly\" becomes \"tgt_vigilantly\"\n- \"with a deep commitment to conservation\" becomes \"tgt_with tgt_a tgt_deep tgt_commitment tgt_to tgt_conservation\"\n\nPutting it all together in the correct order for Language A:\n\n[tgt_in tgt_the tgt_national tgt_park tgt_the tgt_watchful tgt_ranger tgt_the S_wildlife tgt_with tgt_a tgt_deep tgt_commitment tgt_to tgt_conservation tgt_vigilantly tgt_protect_+ .]\n\nSo the final translated sentence in Language A is:\n\n[In the national park the watchful ranger the S_wildlife with a deep commitment to conservation vigilantly protect_+ .]"

For nouns, we add 'S_' for singular and 'P_' for plural. \"Historian\" and \"library\" are singular, and \"period\" is also singular, so we will add 'S_' to each of these.\n\n6.

Singular nouns are indicated by adding 'S_' as a prefix, and plural nouns by adding 'P_' as a prefix.\n5.

Since \"friend\" is singular, we use 'S_' as a prefix. So, it becomes \"tgt_the tgt_thoughtful S_friend\".\n- \"In the cozy café\" is a prepositional phrase modifying the noun \"café\". Since \"café\" is singular, we use 'S_' as a prefix. So, it becomes \"tgt_in tgt_the tgt_cozy S_café\".\n- \"Gives the advice\" is the verb-object part. Since \"advice\" is singular, we use 'S_' as a prefix. The verb is in present tense, so we add '_+' to the verb lemma. So, it becomes \"tgt_give_+ tgt_the S_advice\".\n- \"Sincerely with a listening ear\" is a prepositional phrase followed by an adverb modifying the verb. \"Ear\" is singular, so we use 'S_' as a prefix.

Subject-Object-Verb structure: The subject is \"The determined hikers with backpacks,\" the object is \"the road,\" and the verb is \"walks.\"\n\n2. Prepositional phrases modifying a verb are placed before the verb, and if there is an adverb modifying the verb, the order is prepositional phrase, adverb, then verb.\n\n3. Prepositional phrases modifying a noun are placed before the noun, and if there are determiners or adjectives modifying the noun, the order is prepositional phrases, determiners, adjectives, then noun.\n\n4. Tense is indicated by adding '_-' for past tense and '_+' for present tense to the verb lemma.\n\n5. Adjectives are repeated twice consecutively.\n\nLet's break down the sentence:\n\n- \"The determined hikers with backpacks\" is the subject. According to the rules, the prepositional phrase \"with backpacks\" modifies the noun \"hikers,\" so it comes first, followed by the determiner \"the,\" the adjective \"determined\" (which should be repeated), and then the noun \"hikers.\"\n- \"walks\" is the present tense verb, so we add '_+' to the lemma \"tgt_walk.\"\n- \"the road\" is the object, following the determiner \"the\" and the noun \"road.\"\n- \"tirelessly\" is an adverb modifying the verb, so it comes before the verb.\n- \"up the mountain\" is a prepositional phrase modifying the verb, so it comes before the adverb.\n\nNow, let's translate and reorder the sentence according to these rules:\n\n- Prepositional phrase modifying noun: \"with backpacks\" -> \"tgt_with tgt_backpacks\"\n- Determiner: \"the\" -> \"tgt_the\"\n- Adjective (repeated twice): \"determined\" -> \"tgt_determined tgt_determined\"\n- Noun: \"hikers\" -> \"tgt_hikers\"\n- Prepositional phrase modifying verb: \"up the mountain\" -> \"tgt_up tgt_mountain\"\n- Adverb: \"tirelessly\" -> \"tgt_tirelessly\"\n- Verb (present tense): \"walks\" -> \"tgt_walk_+\"\n- Determiner: \"the\" -> \"tgt_the\"\n- Noun: \"road\" -> \"tgt_road\"\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n[tgt_with tgt_backpacks tgt_the tgt_determined tgt_determined tgt_hikers tgt_up tgt_mountain tgt_tirelessly tgt_walk_+ tgt_the tgt_road]."
