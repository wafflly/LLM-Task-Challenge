The object \"the groundbreaking medicine\" follows the standard English order since there are no specific rules for objects in Language A.\n\n3. The verb \"develops\" will be placed at the end of the sentence following the Subject-Object-Verb structure.\n\n4. The adverbial phrase \"diligently at her desk\" modifies the verb and remains positioned after the verb. However, since \"at her desk\" is a prepositional phrase, it should precede the adverb \"diligently\" according to the rules of Language A.\n\nNow, let's translate each word using the provided word pairs and rearrange the sentence according to the rules:\n\n- The innovative scientist in the advanced lab = In the advanced lab the innovative scientist\n  - \"in\" = tgt_in\n  - \"the\" = tgt_the\n  - \"advanced\" = tgt_advanced\n  - \"lab\" = tgt_lab\n  - \"the\" = tgt_the\n  - \"innovative\" = tgt_innovative\n  - \"scientist\" = tgt_scientist\n\n- develops = tgt_develops\n\n- the groundbreaking medicine = tgt_the tgt_groundbreaking tgt_medicine\n\n- diligently at her desk = at her desk diligently\n  - \"at\" = tgt_at\n  - \"her\" = tgt_her\n  - \"desk\" = tgt_desk\n  - \"diligently\" = tgt_diligently\n\nNow, let's put it all together following the SOV structure and the rules for prepositional and adverbial phrases:\n\n\"In the advanced lab the innovative scientist the groundbreaking medicine develops at her desk diligently.\"\n\nTranslated into Language A with the provided word pairs:\n\n[tgt_in tgt_the tgt_advanced tgt_lab tgt_the tgt_innovative tgt_scientist tgt_the tgt_groundbreaking tgt_medicine tgt_develops tgt_at tgt_her tgt_desk tgt_diligently].\n\nSo the final translated result is:\n\n[in the advanced lab the innovative scientist the groundbreaking medicine develops at her desk diligently]."

Adverbs that modify a verb maintain their position after the verb.\n\nLet's start by translating the subject \"The writer in the room\":\n- \"The writer\" is translated as \"tgt_the tgt_writer\".\n- \"In the room\" is a prepositional phrase modifying \"writer\", so it comes before it: \"tgt_in tgt_the tgt_room tgt_the tgt_writer\".\n\nNow, the object \"a story\" is simply translated as \"tgt_a tgt_story\".\n\nThe verb \"tells\" is translated as \"tgt_tells\".\n\nThe adverb \"slowly\" is translated as \"tgt_slowly\" and remains after the verb.\n\nThe prepositional phrase \"through a microphone\" is modifying the verb, so it comes after the verb and adverb:\n- \"Through\" is translated as \"tgt_through\".\n- \"A microphone\" is translated as \"tgt_a tgt_microphone\".\n\nPutting it all together in the Subject-Object-Verb order, with the adverb and prepositional phrase following the verb, we get:\n[tgt_in tgt_the tgt_room tgt_the tgt_writer tgt_a tgt_story tgt_tells tgt_slowly tgt_through tgt_a tgt_microphone .]\n\nSo the translated sentence in Language A is:\n[in the room the writer a story tells slowly through a microphone .]"

      "content": "To translate the sentence \"The seasoned sailor in the sturdy vessel navigates the rough seas skillfully with a steady hand.\" into Language A, we need to follow the linguistic rules provided and use the word pairs for translation.\n\nFirst, let's identify the structure of the sentence in English:\n\nSubject: The seasoned sailor in the sturdy vessel\nVerb: navigates\nObject: the rough seas\nAdverbial phrase modifying the verb: skillfully\nPrepositional phrase modifying the verb: with a steady hand\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of Language A:\n\n1. The canonical word order is Subject-Object-Verb.\n2. A prepositional phrase modifying a noun is placed before the noun, and if there are determiners or adjectives modifying the noun, the order is prepositional phrases, determiners, adjectives, and then the noun.\n3. Prepositional phrases that modify a verb are positioned after the verb.\n4. Adverbs that modify a verb maintain their position after the verb.\n\nLet's break down the subject phrase \"The seasoned sailor in the sturdy vessel\":\n\n- \"The seasoned sailor\" becomes \"tgt_the tgt_seasoned tgt_sailor\"\n- \"in the sturdy vessel\" becomes \"tgt_in tgt_the tgt_sturdy tgt_vessel\"\n- Following the rule for prepositional phrases modifying a noun, we place the prepositional phrase before the noun phrase: \"tgt_in tgt_the tgt_sturdy tgt_vessel tgt_the tgt_seasoned tgt_sailor\"\n\nNow, let's translate the object \"the rough seas\":\n\n- \"the rough seas\" becomes \"tgt_the tgt_rough tgt_seas\"\n\nThe verb \"navigates\" is simply translated to \"tgt_navigates\".\n\nThe adverbial phrase \"skillfully\" is translated to \"tgt_skillfully\" and remains after the verb.\n\nThe prepositional phrase \"with a steady hand\" modifying the verb is translated to \"tgt_with tgt_a tgt_steady tgt_hand\" and is placed after the adverbial phrase.\n\nPutting it all together in the Subject-Object-Verb order with the adverbial and prepositional phrases after the verb, we get:\n\n[tgt_in tgt_the tgt_sturdy tgt_vessel tgt_the tgt_seasoned tgt_sailor tgt_the tgt_rough tgt_seas tgt_navigates tgt_skillfully tgt_with tgt_a tgt_steady tgt_hand.]\n\nSo the final translated result in Language A is:\n\n[in the sturdy vessel the seasoned sailor the rough seas navigates skillfully with a steady hand.]"

Adverbs that modify a verb maintain their position after the verb.\n\nLet's start by translating the subject phrase \"The strong lifeguard by the turbulent sea\":\n- \"by the turbulent sea\" is a prepositional phrase modifying \"lifeguard\", so it comes first.\n- \"The\" is a determiner, \"strong\" is an adjective, and \"lifeguard\" is the noun.\n\nSo, the subject phrase in Language A would be: \"by the turbulent sea the strong lifeguard\" which translates to \"tgt_by tgt_the tgt_turbulent tgt_sea tgt_the tgt_strong tgt_lifeguard\".\n\nNext, we translate the verb \"rescues\" to \"tgt_rescues\".\n\nThen, we translate the object \"the swimmer\" to \"tgt_the tgt_swimmer\".\n\nThe adverb \"swiftly\" remains after the verb, so it translates to \"tgt_swiftly\".\n\nFinally, the prepositional phrase \"with a firm grip\" modifies the verb and is placed after the adverb. It translates to \"with a firm grip\" as \"tgt_with tgt_a tgt_firm tgt_grip\".\n\nPutting it all together in the Subject-Object-Verb structure with the adverb and prepositional phrase following the verb, we get:\n\n[tgt_by tgt_the tgt_turbulent tgt_sea tgt_the tgt_strong tgt_lifeguard tgt_the tgt_swimmer tgt_rescues tgt_swiftly tgt_with tgt_a tgt_firm tgt_grip]."

So, \"displays a color boldly with a bright red hue\" becomes \"With a bright red hue boldly displays a color\".\n\nNow, let's translate each word using the provided pairs:\n\n- The -> tgt_the\n- delicate -> tgt_delicate\n- violet -> tgt_violet\n- by -> tgt_by\n- the -> tgt_the\n- fence -> tgt_fence\n- displays -> tgt_displays\n- a -> tgt_a\n- color -> tgt_color\n- boldly -> tgt_boldly\n- with -> tgt_with\n- a -> tgt_a\n- bright -> tgt_bright\n- red -> tgt_red\n- hue -> tgt_hue\n- . -> .\n\nPutting it all together, we get the translated sentence in Language A:\n\n[tgt_by tgt_the tgt_fence tgt_the tgt_delicate tgt_violet tgt_with tgt_a tgt_bright tgt_red tgt_hue tgt_boldly tgt_displays tgt_a tgt_color .]\n\nSo the final translated result is:\n\n[By the fence the delicate violet with a bright red hue boldly displays a color .]"

A prepositional phrase modifying a noun is placed before the noun. The phrase \"with dyed hair\" modifies \"hair\", so it comes before \"hair\". However, since \"hair\" is also modified by the adjective \"dyed\" and the determiner \"the\", the order should be prepositional phrase, determiner, adjective, noun: \"with dyed hair\" -> \"tgt_with tgt_the tgt_dyed tgt_hair\".\n\n2. The prepositional phrase \"with passion\" modifies the verb \"cooks\", so it should come before the verb. Since there is also an adverb \"slowly\" modifying the verb, the order should be prepositional phrase, adverb, verb: \"with passion\" -> \"tgt_with tgt_passion tgt_slowly tgt_cooks\".\n\n3. The determiner \"the\" and the adjective \"young\" modify the noun \"lady\", so they come before \"lady\": \"the young lady\" -> \"tgt_the tgt_young tgt_lady\".\n\n4. The noun \"potatoes\" is the object of the verb \"cooks\" and follows the verb in English, so it will do the same in Language A: \"potatoes\" -> \"tgt_potatoes\".\n\nPutting it all together, we get the sentence in Language A:\n\n[tgt_the tgt_young tgt_lady tgt_with tgt_the tgt_dyed tgt_hair tgt_with tgt_passion tgt_slowly tgt_cooks tgt_potatoes .]\n\nSo the translated sentence in Language A is:\n\n[tgt_the tgt_young tgt_lady tgt_with tgt_the tgt_dyed tgt_hair tgt_with tgt_passion tgt_slowly tgt_cooks tgt_potatoes .]"

So, \"with backpacks\" comes before \"the determined hikers\".\n\nFor the prepositional phrase modifying the verb, it comes before the verb, followed by any adverbs, and then the verb itself. So, \"up the mountain\" comes before \"walks\", followed by \"tirelessly\".\n\nNow, let's apply the word pairs to translate each word:\n\n- \"The\" becomes \"tgt_the\"\n- \"determined\" becomes \"tgt_determined\"\n- \"hikers\" becomes \"tgt_hikers\"\n- \"with\" becomes \"tgt_with\"\n- \"backpacks\" becomes \"tgt_backpacks\"\n- \"walks\" becomes \"tgt_walks\"\n- \"the\" becomes \"tgt_the\"\n- \"road\" becomes \"tgt_road\"\n- \"tirelessly\" becomes \"tgt_tirelessly\"\n- \"up\" becomes \"tgt_up\"\n- \"mountain\" becomes \"tgt_mountain\"\n- \".\" remains \".\"\n\nNow, let's put it all together following the rules:\n\n\"The determined hikers with backpacks\" -> \"tgt_with tgt_backpacks tgt_the tgt_determined tgt_hikers\"\n\"walks the road tirelessly up the mountain.\" -> \"tgt_up tgt_the tgt_mountain tgt_tirelessly tgt_walks tgt_the tgt_road .\"\n\nCombining both parts, we get the translated sentence in Language A:\n\n[tgt_with tgt_backpacks tgt_the tgt_determined tgt_hikers tgt_up tgt_the tgt_mountain tgt_tirelessly tgt_walks tgt_the tgt_road .]"
