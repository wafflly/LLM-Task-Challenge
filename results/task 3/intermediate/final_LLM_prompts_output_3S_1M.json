      "content": "To translate the sentence \"The professional photographer by the scenic lake captures the stunning sunset perfectly with his camera.\" into Language A, we need to follow the linguistic rules provided.\n\nFirst, let's identify the structure of the sentence in English:\n- Subject: The professional photographer by the scenic lake\n- Verb: captures\n- Object: the stunning sunset\n- Adverb modifying the verb: perfectly\n- Prepositional phrase modifying the verb: with his camera\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of Language A:\n\n1. The canonical word order in Language A is Subject-Object-Verb.\n2. A prepositional phrase modifying a verb is placed before the verb.\n3. If there is an adverb modifying the verb, the sentence follows the word order of prepositional phrase, adverb, and then the verb.\n4. A prepositional phrase modifying a noun is placed before the noun.\n5. Singular and plural nouns are indicated by adding 'S_' and 'P_' respectively as prefixes to their lemmas.\n\nLet's break down the sentence and apply these rules:\n\n- \"The professional photographer by the scenic lake\" becomes \"By the scenic lake the professional photographer\" (prepositional phrase before the noun, and the noun is singular so we use 'S_' for photographer).\n- \"captures the stunning sunset\" follows the Subject-Object-Verb order, so it remains \"captures the stunning sunset\" (the noun 'sunset' is singular so we use 'S_' for sunset).\n- \"perfectly with his camera\" has an adverb and a prepositional phrase modifying the verb, so it becomes \"with his camera perfectly captures\".\n\nNow, let's replace the English lemmas with the lemmas in Language A:\n\n- professional -> tgt_professional\n- with -> tgt_with\n- capture -> tgt_capture\n- camera -> tgt_camera\n- scenic -> tgt_scenic\n- by -> tgt_by\n- photographer -> tgt_photographer\n- lake -> tgt_lake\n- his -> tgt_his\n- perfectly -> tgt_perfectly\n- stunning -> tgt_stunning\n- sunset -> tgt_sunset\n- the -> tgt_the\n\nApplying these translations and the morphological rule for singular nouns, we get:\n\n- \"By the scenic lake the professional photographer\" -> \"tgt_by tgt_the tgt_scenic tgt_lake tgt_the tgt_professional S_tgt_photographer\"\n- \"captures the stunning sunset\" -> \"tgt_capture tgt_the tgt_stunning S_tgt_sunset\"\n- \"with his camera perfectly captures\" -> \"tgt_with tgt_his tgt_camera tgt_perfectly tgt_capture\"\n\nPutting it all together in the correct order for Language A:\n\n[tgt_by tgt_the tgt_scenic tgt_lake tgt_the tgt_professional S_tgt_photographer tgt_the tgt_stunning S_tgt_sunset tgt_with tgt_his tgt_camera tgt_perfectly tgt_capture .]\n\nSo the final translated sentence in Language A is:\n\n[tgt_by tgt_the tgt_scenic tgt_lake tgt_the tgt_professional S_tgt_photographer tgt_the tgt_stunning S_tgt_sunset tgt_with tgt_his tgt_camera tgt_perfectly tgt_capture .]"

The morphological rule for tense is not needed here because the sentence is in the present tense, so we will use the suffix '_+' for the verb.\n\nLet's translate step by step:\n\n- \"The tall lady with long hair\" becomes \"With long hair the tall lady\" (following rule 4 and 5).\n- \"greets\" is the present tense, so we use \"tgt_greet_+\".\n- \"her friend\" remains the same as there are no prepositional phrases modifying the noun.\n- \"delightedly with a hug\" becomes \"with a hug delightedly\" (following rule 2 and 3).\n\nNow, let's replace the English lemmas with the lemmas in Language A:\n\n- \"The\" translates to \"tgt_the\".\n- \"tall\" translates to \"tgt_tall\".\n- \"lady\" translates to \"tgt_lady\".\n- \"with\" translates to \"tgt_with\".\n- \"long\" translates to \"tgt_long\".\n- \"hair\" translates to \"tgt_hair\".\n- \"greets\" translates to \"tgt_greet_+\".\n- \"her\" translates to \"tgt_her\".\n- \"friend\" translates to \"tgt_friend\".\n- \"delightedly\" translates to \"tgt_delightedly\".\n- \"hug\" translates to \"tgt_hug\".\n\nPutting it all together following the rules, we get:\n\n[tgt_with tgt_long tgt_hair tgt_the tgt_tall tgt_lady tgt_her tgt_friend tgt_with tgt_a tgt_hug tgt_delightedly tgt_greet_+ .]"

According to the rules, the determiner \"the\" and the adjective \"tall\" come before the noun \"tree\". So, it becomes \"tgt_the tgt_tall tgt_tree\".\n- \"With branches\" is a prepositional phrase modifying the noun \"tree\". It should come before the noun phrase. So, it becomes \"tgt_with tgt_branches tgt_the tgt_tall tgt_tree\".\n- \"Whispers\" is the verb, which in present tense becomes \"whisper_+\". \n- \"Secrets\" is the object.\n- \"Softly\" is an adverb modifying the verb \"whispers\".\n- \"In a low volume\" is a prepositional phrase modifying the verb \"whispers\".

      "content": "To translate the sentence \"The talented girl with the rare violin plays the concerto passionately in front of the audience.\" into Language A, we need to follow the linguistic rules provided.\n\nFirst, let's identify the elements of the sentence:\n- Subject: The talented girl with the rare violin\n- Verb: plays\n- Object: the concerto\n- Prepositional phrase modifying the verb: in front of the audience\n- Adverb modifying the verb: passionately\n\nNow, let's apply the rules to translate the sentence:\n\n1. Subject-Object-Verb structure:\n   \"The talented girl with the rare violin the concerto plays.\"\n\n2. Prepositional phrase modifying a verb is placed before the verb, followed by the adverb, then the verb:\n   \"In front of the audience passionately plays.\"\n\n3. Prepositional phrase modifying a noun is placed before the noun, followed by determiners, adjectives, and then the noun:\n   \"With the rare violin the talented girl.\"\n\n4. Morphological rule for tense (present tense in this case):\n   \"play_+\"\n\n5. Replace English lemmas with Language A lemmas:\n   - with -> tgt_with\n   - rare -> tgt_rare\n   - in -> tgt_in\n   - of -> tgt_of\n   - concerto -> tgt_concerto\n   - talented -> tgt_talented\n   - front -> tgt_front\n   - audience -> tgt_audience\n   - play -> tgt_play\n   - violin -> tgt_violin\n   - passionately -> tgt_passionately\n   - the -> tgt_the\n   - girl -> tgt_girl\n\nNow, let's put it all together following the rules:\n\n- \"With the rare violin the talented girl\" becomes \"tgt_with tgt_the tgt_rare tgt_violin tgt_the tgt_talented tgt_girl.\"\n- \"In front of the audience passionately plays\" becomes \"tgt_in tgt_front tgt_of tgt_the tgt_audience tgt_passionately tgt_play_+.\"\n- \"The concerto\" becomes \"tgt_the tgt_concerto.\"\n\nCombining these elements in the Subject-Object-Verb order, we get:\n[tgt_with tgt_the tgt_rare tgt_violin tgt_the tgt_talented tgt_girl tgt_the tgt_concerto tgt_in tgt_front tgt_of tgt_the tgt_audience tgt_passionately tgt_play_+]."
