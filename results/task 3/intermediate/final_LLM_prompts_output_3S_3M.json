According to the rules, the adjective is repeated, and the noun \"player\" is singular, so it becomes \"tgt_the tgt_tall tgt_tall tgt_basketball S_tgt_player\".\n- \"With a fierce determination\" is a prepositional phrase modifying the noun \"player\". The adjective \"fierce\" is repeated, and the noun \"determination\" is singular, so it becomes \"tgt_with tgt_a tgt_fierce tgt_fierce S_tgt_determination\".\n- \"Shoots the winning basket\" follows the Subject-Object-Verb structure. The verb is in present tense, so \"shoots\" becomes \"tgt_shoot_+\". The noun \"basket\" is singular, so it becomes \"S_tgt_basket\". The adjective \"winning\" is not provided in the lemma pairs, but following the rules, it would be repeated if translated.\n- \"Effortlessly during the match\" contains an adverb \"effortlessly\" and a prepositional phrase \"during the match\". According to the rules, the prepositional phrase comes first, followed by the adverb, and then the verb. So it becomes \"tgt_during tgt_the S_tgt_match tgt_effortlessly\".\n\nPutting it all together in the correct order for Language A, we get:\n[tgt_with tgt_a tgt_fierce tgt_fierce S_tgt_determination tgt_the tgt_tall tgt_tall tgt_basketball S_tgt_player tgt_during tgt_the S_tgt_match tgt_effortlessly tgt_shoot_+ tgt_the S_tgt_basket]."

Singular nouns are indicated by adding 'S_' as a prefix, and plural nouns by adding 'P_' as a prefix.\n5. Tense is indicated by adding '_-' for past tense and '_+' for present tense to the verb.\n6. Each adjective is repeated twice consecutively.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to the sentence \"The graceful dancer with a flowing dress performs the traditional dance beautifully on the stage.\"\n\n- \"The graceful dancer\" becomes \"tgt_the tgt_graceful tgt_graceful tgt_dancer\" (adjectives are repeated and the determiner 'the' is translated).\n- \"with a flowing dress\" becomes \"tgt_with tgt_a tgt_flow tgt_flow tgt_dress\" (prepositional phrase modifying the noun 'dress', with the adjective 'flowing' repeated twice).\n- \"performs the traditional dance\" becomes \"tgt_the tgt_traditional tgt_traditional tgt_dance tgt_perform_+\" (the verb 'performs' is in present tense, indicated by '_+', and the adjective 'traditional' is repeated twice).\n- \"beautifully on the stage\" becomes \"tgt_on tgt_the tgt_stage tgt_beautifully\" (prepositional phrase and adverb modifying the verb).\n\nNow, we reorder the sentence according to the Subject-Object-Verb structure and place the prepositional phrase and adverb before the verb:\n\n[tgt_the tgt_graceful tgt_graceful tgt_dancer tgt_with tgt_a tgt_flow tgt_flow tgt_dress tgt_the tgt_traditional tgt_traditional tgt_dance tgt_on tgt_the tgt_stage tgt_beautifully tgt_perform_+]\n\nSo, the translated sentence in Language A is:\n\n[tgt_the tgt_graceful tgt_graceful tgt_dancer tgt_with tgt_a tgt_flow tgt_flow tgt_dress tgt_the tgt_traditional tgt_traditional tgt_dance tgt_on tgt_the tgt_stage tgt_beautifully tgt_perform_+]"

Prepositional phrase modifying a verb is placed before the verb:\n   \"in the sun\" is a prepositional phrase modifying the verb \"chased.\"\n   So, the order will be: \"The quick fox the lazy dog in the sun chased.\"\n\n3. Adverb modifying the verb is placed after the prepositional phrase and before the verb:\n   \"swiftly\" is the adverb modifying the verb \"chased.\"\n   So, the order will be: \"The quick fox the lazy dog in the sun swiftly chased.\"\n\n4. Prepositional phrase modifying a noun is placed before the noun:\n   \"with strong legs\" is a prepositional phrase modifying the noun \"fox.\"\n   So, the order will be: \"The quick fox with strong legs the lazy dog in the sun swiftly chased.\"\n\n5. Morphological rule for nouns (singular/plural):\n   Both \"fox\" and \"dog\" are singular, so we add 'S_' as a prefix to their lemmas.\n   So, the order will be: \"The quick S_fox with strong legs the lazy S_dog in the sun swiftly chased.\"\n\n6. Morphological rule for indicating tense (past/present):\n   \"chased\" is past tense, so we add '_-' as a suffix to the lemma of the verb.\n   So, the order will be: \"The quick S_fox with strong legs the lazy S_dog in the sun swiftly chase_-.\"\n\n7. Each adjective is repeated twice consecutively:\n   \"quick\" and \"strong\" are adjectives, so we repeat them twice.\n   \"lazy\" is also an adjective, so we repeat it twice.\n   So, the order will be: \"The quick quick S_fox with strong strong legs the lazy lazy S_dog in the sun swiftly chase_-.\"\n\n8.

      "content": "To translate the sentence \"The colorful birds above the treetops sing their melodious songs sweetly from their hidden perches.\" into Language A, we need to follow the linguistic rules provided.\n\nFirst, let's identify the components of the sentence:\n- Subject: The colorful birds\n- Prepositional phrase modifying the subject: above the treetops\n- Verb: sing\n- Object: their melodious songs\n- Adverb modifying the verb: sweetly\n- Prepositional phrase modifying the verb: from their hidden perches\n\nNow, let's apply the rules to each component:\n\n1. The canonical word order in Language A is Subject-Object-Verb.\n2. Prepositional phrases modifying a verb are placed before the verb, followed by any adverbs, and then the verb.\n3. Prepositional phrases modifying a noun are placed before the noun, followed by determiners, adjectives (repeated twice), and then the noun.\n4. Singular nouns are indicated by adding 'S_' as a prefix, and plural nouns by adding 'P_' as a prefix.\n5. Tense is indicated by adding '_-' for past tense and '_+' for present tense to the verb.\n6. Adjectives are repeated twice consecutively.\n\nLet's translate step by step:\n\n- \"The colorful birds\" becomes \"tgt_the tgt_colorful tgt_colorful P_tgt_bird\" (following the plural noun rule and the adjective repetition rule).\n- \"Above the treetops\" becomes \"tgt_above tgt_the S_tgt_treetop\" (following the prepositional phrase modifying a noun rule).\n- \"Sing\" in present tense becomes \"tgt_sing_+\" (following the tense rule).\n- \"Their melodious songs\" becomes \"tgt_their tgt_melodious tgt_melodious P_tgt_song\" (following the plural noun rule and the adjective repetition rule).\n- \"Sweetly from their hidden perches\" becomes \"tgt_sweetly tgt_from tgt_their tgt_hide tgt_hide S_tgt_perch\" (following the prepositional phrase modifying a verb rule, the adverb placement rule, and the adjective repetition rule).\n\nNow, let's put it all together following the Subject-Object-Verb structure and the placement of prepositional phrases and adverbs:\n\n[tgt_above tgt_the S_tgt_treetop tgt_the tgt_colorful tgt_colorful P_tgt_bird tgt_their tgt_melodious tgt_melodious P_tgt_song tgt_sweetly tgt_from tgt_their tgt_hide tgt_hide S_tgt_perch tgt_sing_+]\n\nSo the final translated sentence in Language A is:\n\n[tgt_above tgt_the S_tgt_treetop tgt_the tgt_colorful tgt_colorful P_tgt_bird tgt_their tgt_melodious tgt_melodious P_tgt_song tgt_sweetly tgt_from tgt_their tgt_hide tgt_hide S_tgt_perch tgt_sing_+]"

So, the order should be \"The energetic boy the structure climbs\".\n\n2.

So, \"with boundless enthusiasm eagerly climbs\".\n\n3. Prepositional phrase modifying a noun (\"at the playground\") is placed before the noun. The order is prepositional phrase, determiners, adjectives, then noun. So, \"at the playground the energetic energetic boy\".\n\n4. Morphological rule for nouns: \"the structure\" is singular, so we add 'S_' to \"structure\". \"The boy\" is also singular, so we add 'S_' to \"boy\".\n\n5.

Subject-Object-Verb structure: \"The persistent vine\" is the subject, \"the old wall\" is the object, and \"climbs\" is the verb. So, the order should be \"The persistent vine the old wall climbs.\"\n\n2. Prepositional phrases modifying a verb are placed before the verb, and if there is an adverb modifying the verb, the order is prepositional phrase, adverb, then verb. The prepositional phrase here is \"with its tendrils\" and the adverb is \"tightly.\" So, the order should be \"with its tendrils tightly climbs.\"\n\n3. Prepositional phrases modifying a noun are placed before the noun. The prepositional phrase here is \"outside the house,\" which modifies \"the vine.\" So, the order should be \"outside the house the persistent vine.\"\n\n4. Morphological rule for nouns: \"vine\" and \"wall\" are singular nouns, so we add 'S_' as a prefix to their lemmas. \"house\" is also a singular noun, so it should be \"S_house.\"\n\n5. Morphological rule for tense: The verb \"climbs\" is in the present tense, so we add '_+' as a suffix to its lemma.\n\n6. Each adjective is repeated twice consecutively: \"persistent\" and \"old\" are adjectives, so they should be \"persistent persistent\" and \"old old\" respectively.\n\nNow, let's apply the lemma translations provided:\n\n- persistent -> tgt_persistent\n- vine -> tgt_vine\n- its -> tgt_its\n- wall -> tgt_wall\n- tightly -> tgt_tightly\n- the -> tgt_the\n- climb -> tgt_climb\n- with -> tgt_with\n- old -> tgt_old\n- tendril -> tgt_tendril\n- house -> tgt_house\n- outside -> tgt_outside\n\nThe translated sentence, following the rules and lemma translations, will be:\n\n\"[tgt_outside tgt_the S_tgt_house tgt_the tgt_persistent tgt_persistent S_tgt_vine tgt_the tgt_old tgt_old S_tgt_wall tgt_with tgt_its P_tgt_tendril tgt_tightly tgt_climb_+]\"\n\nBreaking it down:\n- \"outside the house\" -> \"tgt_outside tgt_the S_tgt_house\"\n- \"the persistent vine\" -> \"tgt_the tgt_persistent tgt_persistent S_tgt_vine\"\n- \"the old wall\" -> \"tgt_the tgt_old tgt_old S_tgt_wall\"\n- \"with its tendrils\" -> \"tgt_with tgt_its P_tgt_tendril\"\n- \"climbs\" (present tense) -> \"tgt_climb_+\"\n- \"tightly\" -> \"tgt_tightly\"\n\nPutting it all together, we get the final translated sentence in Language A:\n\n[tgt_outside tgt_the S_tgt_house tgt_the tgt_persistent tgt_persistent S_tgt_vine tgt_the tgt_old tgt_old S_tgt_wall tgt_with tgt_its P_tgt_tendril tgt_tightly tgt_climb_+]."

The morphological rule for indicating tense involves adding '_-' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate past tense, and '_+' as a suffix to indicate present tense.\n   Since \"shapes\" is present tense, we add '_+' to \"shape\".\n   Language A: \"In tgt_studio the tgt_imaginative tgt_imaginative tgt_artist with tgt_her P_hand tgt_dexterously tgt_shape_+ the S_figure.\"\n\n6. Each adjective is repeated twice consecutively in a sentence.\n   This has already been applied in step 3.\n\n7. Translate the lemmas using the provided pairs:\n   \"In tgt_studio the tgt_imaginative tgt_imaginative tgt_artist with tgt_her P_hand tgt_dexterously tgt_shape_+ the S_figure.\"\n\nPutting it all together according to the rules and the provided lemma translations, we get the final translation in Language A:\n\n[in tgt_studio the tgt_imaginative tgt_imaginative tgt_artist with tgt_her P_hand tgt_dexterously tgt_shape_+ the S_figure .]\n\nSo the translated sentence in Language A is:\n\n[in tgt_studio the tgt_imaginative tgt_imaginative tgt_artist with tgt_her P_hand tgt_dexterously tgt_shape_+ the S_figure .]"
