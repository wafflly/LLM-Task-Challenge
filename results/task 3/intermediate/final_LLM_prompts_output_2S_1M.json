Also, \"popular\" is an adjective and should be repeated twice.\n- \"served the coffee warmly\" - \"warmly\" is an adverb modifying \"served\" and should come before the verb.\n- \"to the regular customers\" - \"to the regular customers\" is a prepositional phrase modifying \"served\". \"regular\" is an adjective and should be repeated twice.\n\nNow, let's translate the sentence into Language A using the provided lemma pairs:\n\n\"The workers at the popular cafe served the coffee warmly to the regular customers.\"\n- \"The workers\" -> \"tgt_the tgt_worker\"\n- \"at the popular cafe\" -> \"tgt_at tgt_the tgt_popular tgt_popular tgt_cafe\"\n- \"served\" -> \"tgt_serve\"\n- \"the coffee\" -> \"tgt_the tgt_coffee\"\n- \"warmly\" -> \"tgt_warmly\"\n- \"to the regular customers\" -> \"tgt_to tgt_the tgt_regular tgt_regular tgt_customer\"\n\nPutting it all together following the rules:\n\n[tgt_at tgt_the tgt_popular tgt_popular tgt_cafe tgt_the tgt_worker tgt_to tgt_the tgt_regular tgt_regular tgt_customer tgt_warmly tgt_serve tgt_the tgt_coffee].\n\nSo the final translated result is:\n\n[tgt_at tgt_the tgt_popular tgt_popular tgt_cafe tgt_the tgt_worker tgt_to tgt_the tgt_regular tgt_regular tgt_customer tgt_warmly tgt_serve tgt_the tgt_coffee]."

Prepositional phrases modifying a verb are placed before the verb. The sentence has two prepositional phrases, \"with a box of crayons\" and \"on the blank paper\", but \"on the blank paper\" modifies \"paper\", not the verb \"draws\". So, only \"with a box of crayons\" is placed before the verb.\n\n2. If there is an adverb modifying the verb, the sentence follows the word order of prepositional phrase, adverb, and then the verb.

Prepositional phrases modifying a noun are placed before the noun. \"On the blank paper\" modifies \"paper\", so it will come before \"paper\".\n\n4. The sentence follows the word order of prepositional phrases, determiners, adjectives, and then the noun.

We use \"tgt_slowly\".\n- \"Into the vase\" is a prepositional phrase modifying the verb \"puts\". We use \"tgt_into\" and \"S_tgt_vase\" since \"vase\" is singular.\n\nNow, let's put it all together following the rules of Language A:\n- The subject: tgt_the tgt_retired tgt_man tgt_in tgt_the tgt_lush tgt_garden\n- The object: tgt_the tgt_fragrant P_tgt_flower\n- The prepositional phrase modifying the verb: tgt_into tgt_the S_tgt_vase\n- The adverb: tgt_slowly\n- The verb: tgt_put\n\nThe final sentence in Language A should be:\n[tgt_the tgt_retired tgt_man tgt_in tgt_the tgt_lush tgt_garden tgt_the tgt_fragrant P_tgt_flower tgt_into tgt_the S_tgt_vase tgt_slowly tgt_put]."

Translate the nouns and mark them for singularity/plurality:\n- babysitter -> S_babysitter (singular)\n- children -> P_child (plural)\n- demeanor -> S_demeanor (singular)\n\n2. Translate the adjectives and adverbs:\n- attentive -> tgt_attentive\n- kind -> tgt_kind\n- energetic -> tgt_energetic\n- carefully -> tgt_carefully\n\n3. Translate the prepositions:\n- with -> tgt_with\n- in -> tgt_in\n\n4. Translate the articles:\n- the -> tgt_the\n- a -> tgt_a\n\n5. Translate the verb:\n- watches -> tgt_watch\n\nNow, let's put the sentence together following the rules of Language A:\n\n- Subject: tgt_the tgt_attentive S_babysitter tgt_with tgt_a tgt_kind S_demeanor\n- Object: tgt_the tgt_energetic P_child\n- Prepositional phrase modifying the verb: tgt_in tgt_the S_backyard\n- Adverb modifying the verb: tgt_carefully\n- Verb: tgt_watch\n\nAccording to the rules, the prepositional phrase and adverb come before the verb, and the sentence structure is Subject-Object-Verb.

The morphological rule for tense is to add '_-' for past tense and '_+' for present tense to the verb lemma.\n\nLet's break down the sentence:\n\n- \"The loyal dog\" translates to \"tgt_the tgt_loyal tgt_dog\".\n- \"in the sunny yard\" translates to \"tgt_in tgt_the tgt_sunny tgt_yard\" and is placed before \"tgt_the tgt_loyal tgt_dog\" because it's a prepositional phrase modifying the noun.\n- \"guards\" is the present tense verb, so it translates to \"tgt_guard_+\".\n- \"the house\" translates to \"tgt_the tgt_house\".\n- \"vigilantly\" translates to \"tgt_vigilantly\" and remains after the verb.\n- \"with a watchful stance\" translates to \"tgt_with tgt_a tgt_watchful tgt_stance\" and is placed after the verb because it's a prepositional phrase modifying the verb.\n\nPutting it all together following the Subject-Object-Verb structure:\n\n[tgt_in tgt_the tgt_sunny tgt_yard tgt_the tgt_loyal tgt_dog tgt_the tgt_house tgt_guard_+ tgt_vigilantly tgt_with tgt_a tgt_watchful tgt_stance .]\n\nSo the final translated sentence in Language A is:\n\n[tgt_in tgt_the tgt_sunny tgt_yard tgt_the tgt_loyal tgt_dog tgt_the tgt_house tgt_guard_+ tgt_vigilantly tgt_with tgt_a tgt_watchful tgt_stance .]"

The canonical word order in Language A is Subject-Object-Verb, so we'll maintain the subject \"The attentive mother\" at the beginning, followed by the object \"the cookies,\" and then the verb \"bakes.\"\n\n2. A prepositional phrase modifying a noun is placed before the noun. The phrase \"in the warm kitchen\" modifies \"The attentive mother,\" so it will come before \"The attentive mother.\"\n\n3. Determiners and adjectives follow the order of prepositional phrases, determiners, adjectives, and then the noun. So, \"in the warm kitchen\" will be followed by \"the attentive mother.\"\n\n4. Prepositional phrases that modify a verb remain positioned after the verb. Therefore, \"with a secret recipe\" will come after \"bakes.\"\n\n5. Adverbs that modify a verb maintain their position after the verb. Thus, \"lovingly\" will also come after \"bakes.\"\n\n6. The morphological rule for tense indicates that we should add \"_+\" to the lemma of the verb \"bake\" to show present tense.\n\nNow, let's translate the individual words using the provided lemma pairs and apply the rules to construct the sentence in Language A:\n\n- The attentive mother = tgt_the tgt_attentive tgt_mother\n- in the warm kitchen = tgt_in tgt_the tgt_warm tgt_kitchen\n- bakes = tgt_bake_+\n- the cookies = tgt_the tgt_cookie\n- lovingly = tgt_lovingly\n- with a secret recipe = tgt_with tgt_a tgt_secret tgt_recipe\n\nPutting it all together in the correct order for Language A:\n\n[tgt_in tgt_the tgt_warm tgt_kitchen tgt_the tgt_attentive tgt_mother tgt_the tgt_cookie tgt_bake_+ tgt_lovingly tgt_with tgt_a tgt_secret tgt_recipe .]\n\nSo, the translated sentence in Language A is:\n\n[in the warm kitchen the attentive mother the cookies bake_+ lovingly with a secret recipe .]"
