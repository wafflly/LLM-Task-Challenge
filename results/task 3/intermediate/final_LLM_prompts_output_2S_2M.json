The canonical word order is Subject-Object-Verb, so we start with \"The pupil the thick book reads\".\n2. Prepositional phrases modifying a verb are placed before the verb, and if there is an adverb modifying the verb, the order is prepositional phrase, adverb, then verb. So we have \"The pupil the thick book with great interest slowly reads\".\n3. Prepositional phrases that modify a noun remain positioned after the noun, so \"The pupil in the library\" remains unchanged.\n4. For nouns, we add 'S_' for singular and 'P_' for plural. Since \"pupil\" and \"book\" are singular, we have \"S_pupil\" and \"S_book\".\n5. For tense, we add '_+' for present tense. Since \"reads\" is present tense, we have \"read_+\".\n\nNow, let's replace the English lemmas with the lemmas in Language A using the provided translations:\n\n- The (tgt_the)\n- Pupil (S_tgt_pupil)\n- In the library (tgt_in tgt_the tgt_library)\n- Reads (read_+)\n- The thick book (tgt_the tgt_thick S_tgt_book)\n- Slowly (tgt_slowly)\n- With great interest (tgt_with tgt_great tgt_interest)\n\nPutting it all together following the rules, we get:\n\n[tgt_the S_tgt_pupil tgt_in tgt_the tgt_library tgt_the tgt_thick S_tgt_book tgt_with tgt_great tgt_interest tgt_slowly read_+]\n\nSo the translated sentence in Language A is:\n\n[tgt_the S_tgt_pupil tgt_in tgt_the tgt_library tgt_the tgt_thick S_tgt_book tgt_with tgt_great tgt_interest tgt_slowly read_+]"

According to the rules, the prepositional phrase comes first, followed by the adverb, and then the verb.\n\nNow, let's translate and reorder the sentence:\n\n- \"at the cozy café\" -> \"tgt_at tgt_the tgt_cozy tgt_cozy tgt_café\"\n- \"The friendly waiter\" -> \"tgt_the tgt_friendly tgt_friendly tgt_waiter\"\n- \"serves\" (present tense) -> \"tgt_serve_+\"\n- \"the hot coffee\" -> \"tgt_the tgt_hot tgt_hot tgt_coffee\"\n- \"cheerfully with a smile\" -> \"tgt_with tgt_a tgt_smile tgt_cheerfully\"\n\nPutting it all together following the rules:\n\n[tgt_at tgt_the tgt_cozy tgt_cozy tgt_café tgt_the tgt_friendly tgt_friendly tgt_waiter tgt_with tgt_a tgt_smile tgt_cheerfully tgt_serve_+ tgt_the tgt_hot tgt_hot tgt_coffee .]"

Tense is indicated by adding '_-' for past tense and '_+' for present tense as a suffix to the verb lemma.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules step by step:\n\n- The subject \"The knowledgeable historian\" remains at the beginning of the sentence.\n- The prepositional phrase \"in the ancient library\" modifies the noun \"historian\" and thus remains after it.\n- The object \"the old manuscript\" follows the subject.\n- The prepositional phrase \"with great care\" and the adverb \"diligently\" modify the verb \"researched\" and should be placed before the verb.\n- The verb \"researched\" is in the past tense, so we add '_-' to the lemma.\n\nNow, let's apply the morphological rules:\n\n- \"historian\" is singular, so we add 'S_' to make it 'S_historian'.\n- \"manuscript\" is singular, so we add 'S_' to make it 'S_manuscript'.\n- \"researched\" is past tense, so we add '_-' to make it 'research_-'.\n\nFinally, we replace the English lemmas with the lemmas in Language A:\n\n- \"care\" becomes \"tgt_care\"\n- \"ancient\" becomes \"tgt_ancient\"\n- \"manuscript\" becomes \"tgt_manuscript\"\n- \"library\" becomes \"tgt_library\"\n- \"in\" becomes \"tgt_in\"\n- \"old\" becomes \"tgt_old\"\n- \"with\" becomes \"tgt_with\"\n- \"research\" becomes \"tgt_research\"\n- \"diligently\" becomes \"tgt_diligently\"\n- \"knowledgeable\" becomes \"tgt_knowledgeable\"\n- \"the\" becomes \"tgt_the\"\n- \"great\" becomes \"tgt_great\"\n- \"historian\" becomes \"tgt_historian\"\n\nNow, let's put it all together:\n\n\"The knowledgeable historian in the ancient library researched the old manuscript diligently with great care.\" becomes:\n\n\"tgt_the tgt_knowledgeable S_tgt_historian tgt_in tgt_the tgt_ancient tgt_library tgt_the S_tgt_manuscript tgt_with tgt_great tgt_care tgt_diligently tgt_research_-.\"\n\nPutting the final translated result in brackets:\n\n[tgt_the tgt_knowledgeable S_tgt_historian tgt_in tgt_the tgt_ancient tgt_library tgt_the S_tgt_manuscript tgt_with tgt_great tgt_care tgt_diligently tgt_research_-]."

The morphological rule for tense is to add '_-' for past tense and '_+' for present tense to the verb lemma.\n6. Each adjective is repeated twice consecutively.\n\nLet's break down the sentence:\n\n- \"The curious cat\" follows the order of determiner, adjective, and noun. According to rule 4, we need to repeat the adjective twice. So it becomes \"tgt_the tgt_curious tgt_curious tgt_cat\".\n- \"with green eyes\" is a prepositional phrase modifying the noun \"eyes\", which in turn modifies \"cat\". According to rule 3, it should come before the noun, and the adjective \"green\" should be repeated twice. So it becomes \"tgt_with tgt_green tgt_green tgt_eye\".\n- \"crosses the room\" is the verb followed by the object. According to rule 5, since it's present tense, we add '_+' to \"cross\". So it becomes \"tgt_cross_+ tgt_room\".\n- \"quietly with ease\" are adverbs modifying the verb \"crosses\". According to rule 2, they should come before the verb. So it becomes \"tgt_quietly tgt_with tgt_ease\".\n\nNow, let's put it all together following the rules of Language A:\n\n[tgt_the tgt_curious tgt_curious tgt_cat tgt_with tgt_green tgt_green tgt_eye tgt_quietly tgt_with tgt_ease tgt_cross_+ tgt_room]."

The canonical word order is Subject-Object-Verb, so the basic structure will be \"The secluded pond the sky reflects\".\n2. Prepositional phrases modifying a verb are placed before the verb. The sentence has two prepositional phrases modifying the verb \"reflects\": \"by the mountain\" and \"with its tranquil surface\". However, since \"with its tranquil surface\" modifies the noun \"pond\", it should remain after \"pond\" as per the rules.\n3. If there is an adverb modifying the verb, the sentence follows the word order of prepositional phrase, adverb, and then the verb. The adverb \"clearly\" modifies the verb \"reflects\", so it should be placed before the verb but after the prepositional phrase \"by the mountain\".\n4. The morphological rule for nouns involves adding 'S_' for singular nouns. In this sentence, \"pond\", \"mountain\", and \"sky\" are singular nouns.\n5. The morphological rule for indicating tense involves adding '_+' for present tense verbs. The verb \"reflects\" is in the present tense.\n\nApplying these rules, we get the following structure:\n\n\"The secluded S_pond by the mountain clearly reflects the S_sky with its tranquil S_surface.\"\n\nNow, let's replace the English words with their Language A lemmas:\n\n[tgt_the tgt_secluded S_pond tgt_by tgt_the S_mountain tgt_clearly tgt_reflect_+ tgt_the S_sky tgt_with tgt_its tgt_tranquil S_surface .]\n\nPutting it all together, the translated sentence in Language A is:\n\n[tgt_the tgt_secluded S_pond tgt_by tgt_the S_mountain tgt_clearly tgt_reflect_+ tgt_the S_sky tgt_with tgt_its tgt_tranquil S_surface .]"

Prepositional phrase modifying a noun placed before the noun:\n   English: The young man with an ambition...\n   Language A: With an ambition the young man...\n\n3. Determiners, adjectives, and then the noun:\n   Since 'young' is an adjective, it should be repeated twice and placed before 'man':\n   Language A: With an ambition the young young man...\n\n4. Morphological rule for nouns:\n   'Man' is singular, so we add 'S_' as a prefix to 'tgt_man':\n   Language A: With an ambition the young young S_tgt_man...\n\n5. Prepositional phrases that modify a verb remain after the verb:\n   The phrase 'from scratch' modifies the verb 'builds', so it remains after the verb in Language A.\n\n6. Adverbs that modify a verb maintain their position after the verb:\n   The adverb 'passionately' modifies the verb 'builds', so it remains after the verb in Language A.\n\n7. Translate the lemmas:\n   We replace the English lemmas with their corresponding lemmas in Language A:\n   - from -> tgt_from\n   - man -> tgt_man\n   - ambition -> tgt_ambition\n   - build -> tgt_build\n   - with -> tgt_with\n   - an -> tgt_an\n   - house -> tgt_house\n   - scratch -> tgt_scratch\n   - his -> tgt_his\n   - young -> tgt_young\n   - the -> tgt_the\n   - passionately -> tgt_passionately\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n[tgt_the tgt_young tgt_young S_tgt_man tgt_with tgt_an tgt_ambition tgt_his tgt_house tgt_passionately tgt_build tgt_from tgt_scratch].\n\nHowever, we need to remember that 'house' is singular, so we should add 'S_' as a prefix to 'tgt_house':\n[tgt_the tgt_young tgt_young S_tgt_man tgt_with tgt_an tgt_ambition tgt_his S_tgt_house tgt_passionately tgt_build tgt_from tgt_scratch].\n\nSo the final translated sentence in Language A is:\n[The young young S_man with an S_ambition his S_house passionately builds from scratch]."
