According to the rules, \"with a wagging tail\" is a prepositional phrase modifying \"dog,\" so it comes first, followed by the determiner \"the,\" then the adjective \"loyal\" (which should be repeated twice), and finally the noun \"dog.\"\n- \"fetches the thrown stick\" is the main verb phrase with \"fetches\" being the present tense verb, so we add '_+' to \"fetch.\" \"The thrown stick\" is the object, with \"the\" as the determiner and \"thrown\" as the adjective modifying \"stick.\"\n- \"eagerly\" is an adverb modifying the verb \"fetches,\" so it remains after the verb.\n- \"in the park\" is a prepositional phrase modifying the verb phrase \"fetches the thrown stick,\" so it is placed at the end of the sentence.\n\nNow, let's translate each part:\n\n- \"with a wagging tail\" -> \"tgt_with tgt_a tgt_wag_- tgt_tail\"\n- \"The loyal dog\" -> \"tgt_the tgt_loyal tgt_loyal tgt_dog\"\n- \"fetches\" -> \"tgt_fetch_+\"\n- \"the thrown stick\" -> \"tgt_the tgt_throw_- tgt_stick\"\n- \"eagerly\" -> \"tgt_eagerly\"\n- \"in the park\" -> \"tgt_in tgt_the tgt_park\"\n\nPutting it all together according to the rules, we get:\n\n[tgt_with tgt_a tgt_wag_- tgt_tail tgt_the tgt_loyal tgt_loyal tgt_dog tgt_fetch_+ tgt_the tgt_throw_- tgt_stick tgt_eagerly tgt_in tgt_the tgt_park .]"

Each adjective is repeated twice consecutively in a sentence.\n\nLet's break down the sentence:\n\n- \"The scientists\" is a plural noun, so we use 'P_' and the lemma 'tgt_scientist'.\n- \"in the modern lab\" is a prepositional phrase modifying the noun \"lab\", so it stays after \"lab\". \"modern\" is an adjective, so it is repeated twice.\n- \"develop\" is the verb.\n- \"the new medicine\" is the object, with \"new\" being an adjective that needs to be repeated twice.\n- \"carefully\" is an adverb modifying the verb \"develop\".\n- \"through research\" is a prepositional phrase modifying the verb \"develop\", so it goes before the adverb and the verb.\n\nNow, let's apply the lemmas and the rules to translate the sentence:\n\n\"The scientists\" -> \"tgt_the P_tgt_scientist\"\n\"in the modern lab\" -> \"tgt_in the tgt_new tgt_new tgt_lab\"\n\"develop\" -> \"tgt_develop\"\n\"the new medicine\" -> \"tgt_the tgt_new tgt_new tgt_medicine\"\n\"carefully\" -> \"tgt_carefully\"\n\"through research\" -> \"tgt_through tgt_research\"\n\nFollowing the word order rules, we get:\n\n\"The scientists in the modern lab develop the new medicine carefully through research.\" ->\n\"tgt_the P_tgt_scientist tgt_in the tgt_new tgt_new tgt_lab tgt_through tgt_research tgt_carefully tgt_develop tgt_the tgt_new tgt_new tgt_medicine .\"\n\nPutting it all together in brackets as requested:\n\n[tgt_the P_tgt_scientist tgt_in the tgt_new tgt_new tgt_lab tgt_through tgt_research tgt_carefully tgt_develop tgt_the tgt_new tgt_new tgt_medicine .]"

Prepositional phrases modifying a noun remain after the noun.\n4. Singular nouns are prefixed with 'S_', and plural nouns with 'P_'.\n5. Adjectives are repeated twice consecutively.\n\nLet's break down the sentence:\n\n- \"The happy hikers\" translates to \"tgt_the tgt_happy tgt_happy P_tgt_hiker\" because \"hikers\" is plural and \"happy\" is an adjective that needs to be repeated.\n- \"on the rocky path\" translates to \"tgt_on the tgt_rocky tgt_rocky tgt_path\" because \"rocky\" is an adjective that needs to be repeated and the prepositional phrase modifies the noun \"path\".\n- \"climb the mountain\" translates to \"tgt_climb tgt_the S_tgt_mountain\" because \"mountain\" is singular.\n- \"bravely\" translates to \"tgt_bravely\" because it is an adverb modifying the verb \"climb\".\n- \"with strong grips\" translates to \"tgt_with tgt_strong tgt_strong P_tgt_grip\" because \"grips\" is plural and \"strong\" is an adjective that needs to be repeated.\n\nNow, we need to arrange the sentence according to the rules:\n\n- Prepositional phrase modifying the verb (\"with strong grips\") comes first.\n- Adverb modifying the verb (\"bravely\") comes next.\n- Then the verb (\"climb\").\n- The subject (\"The happy hikers\") comes before the verb.\n- The prepositional phrase modifying the noun (\"on the rocky path\") comes after the noun it modifies.\n\nSo the sentence structure in Language A will be:\n\n\"The happy hikers with strong grips bravely climb on the rocky path the mountain.\"\n\nNow, let's put it all together with the translated lemmas:\n\n[tgt_the tgt_happy tgt_happy P_tgt_hiker tgt_with tgt_strong tgt_strong P_tgt_grip tgt_bravely tgt_climb tgt_on tgt_rocky tgt_rocky tgt_path tgt_the S_tgt_mountain .]\n\nThis is the translated sentence in Language A."

The adverb remains after the verb, and the prepositional phrase follows the adverb.\n\nNow, let's translate each part:\n\n- \"The attentive listener in the lively conversation\" becomes \"In tgt_in the tgt_lively tgt_lively tgt_conversation tgt_the tgt_attentive tgt_attentive tgt_listener\".\n- \"absorbs the details\" becomes \"tgt_absorb_+ tgt_the tgt_detail\".\n- \"keenly with an open mind\" becomes \"tgt_keenly tgt_with tgt_an tgt_open tgt_mind\".\n\nPutting it all together, we get the translated sentence in Language A:\n\n[In tgt_in the tgt_lively tgt_lively tgt_conversation tgt_the tgt_attentive tgt_attentive tgt_listener tgt_absorb_+ tgt_the tgt_detail tgt_keenly tgt_with tgt_an tgt_open tgt_mind .]"

Each adjective is repeated twice consecutively in a sentence.\n\nLet's break down the sentence and apply these rules:\n\n- \"The professional critic at the premiere\" remains mostly the same, but with the adjective \"professional\" repeated twice and the noun \"critic\" prefixed with 'S_' to indicate it is singular.\n- \"reviews the film\" will have the noun \"film\" prefixed with 'S_' to indicate it is singular.\n- \"critically with an analytical approach\" is a prepositional phrase followed by an adverb modifying the verb \"reviews\". According to the rules, this phrase and adverb should come before the verb. Also, the adjective \"analytical\" is repeated twice, and the noun \"approach\" is prefixed with 'S_' to indicate it is singular.\n\nNow, let's apply the lemma translations:\n\n- \"The\" translates to \"tgt_the\".\n- \"professional\" remains \"tgt_professional\" but is repeated twice.\n- \"critic\" translates to \"tgt_critic\" and is prefixed with 'S_'.\n- \"at\" translates to \"tgt_at\".\n- \"the\" translates to \"tgt_the\".\n- \"premiere\" translates to \"tgt_premiere\".\n- \"reviews\" translates to \"tgt_review\".\n- \"the\" translates to \"tgt_the\".\n- \"film\" translates to \"tgt_film\" and is prefixed with 'S_'.\n- \"critically\" translates to \"tgt_critically\".\n- \"with\" translates to \"tgt_with\".\n- \"an\" translates to \"tgt_an\".\n- \"analytical\" remains \"tgt_analytical\" but is repeated twice.\n- \"approach\" translates to \"tgt_approach\" and is prefixed with 'S_'.\n\nPutting it all together following the rules:\n\n[tgt_the tgt_professional tgt_professional S_tgt_critic tgt_at tgt_the tgt_premiere tgt_with tgt_an tgt_analytical tgt_analytical S_tgt_approach tgt_critically tgt_review tgt_the S_tgt_film .]\n\nSo the translated sentence in Language A is:\n\n[tgt_the tgt_professional tgt_professional S_tgt_critic tgt_at tgt_the tgt_premiere tgt_with tgt_an tgt_analytical tgt_analytical S_tgt_approach tgt_critically tgt_review tgt_the S_tgt_film .]"

Apply the Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) structure:\n   - \"The prestigious mage in a wizard hat\" (Subject)\n   - \"fire\" (Object)\n   - \"shoots consistently to the enemies\" (Verb Phrase)\n\n3. Apply the morphological rules for nouns:\n   - Since 'mage' and 'hat' are singular, we add 'S_' as a prefix.\n   - 'Enemies' is plural, so we add 'P_' as a prefix.\n\n4. Apply the morphological rules for tense:\n   - The verb 'shoots' is in the present tense, so we add '_+' as a suffix.\n\n5.

Tense is indicated by adding '_-' for past tense and '_+' for present tense to the verb.\n\nLet's break down the sentence:\n\n- \"The imaginative artist\" is the subject. \"Artist\" is a singular noun, so we add 'S_' to \"tgt_artist\" and \"imaginative\" is an adjective modifying \"artist\", so it remains before it.\n- \"In the studio\" is a prepositional phrase modifying \"artist\", so it remains after \"artist\".\n- \"Shapes\" is the verb in present tense, so we add '_+' to \"tgt_shape\".\n- \"The figure\" is the object. \"Figure\" is a singular noun, so we add 'S_' to \"tgt_figure\".\n- \"Dexterously\" is an adverb modifying the verb \"shapes\", so it remains after the verb.\n- \"With her hands\" is a prepositional phrase modifying the verb \"shapes\". \"Hands\" is a plural noun, so we add 'P_' to \"tgt_hand\".\n\nNow, let's put it all together following the rules:\n\nThe imaginative artist in the studio shapes the figure dexterously with her hands.\n[tgt_the tgt_imaginative S_tgt_artist tgt_in tgt_studio tgt_shape_+ tgt_the S_tgt_figure tgt_dexterously tgt_with tgt_her P_tgt_hand .]\n\nSo the translated sentence in Language A is:\n\n[tgt_the tgt_imaginative S_tgt_artist tgt_in tgt_studio tgt_shape_+ tgt_the S_tgt_figure tgt_dexterously tgt_with tgt_her P_tgt_hand .]"
