Prepositional phrases modifying a verb are placed before the verb, and if there is an adverb modifying the verb, the order is prepositional phrase, adverb, then verb. Here, \"warmly\" is the adverb modifying the verb \"presents,\" and \"with a hug\" is the prepositional phrase.\n\n3. Prepositional phrases modifying a noun are placed before the noun, and if there are determiners or adjectives modifying the noun, the order is prepositional phrases, determiners, adjectives, and then the noun. Here, \"at the surprise party\" is the prepositional phrase modifying \"The thoughtful friend,\" and \"handmade\" is the adjective modifying \"the gift.\"\n\nNow, let's translate the sentence step by step:\n\n- \"The thoughtful friend at the surprise party\" becomes \"at the surprise party the thoughtful friend\" which translates to \"tgt_at tgt_the tgt_surprise tgt_party tgt_the tgt_thoughtful tgt_friend.\"\n- \"The handmade gift\" becomes \"the handmade gift\" which translates to \"tgt_the tgt_handmade tgt_gift.\"\n- \"Presents warmly with a hug\" becomes \"with a hug warmly presents\" which translates to \"tgt_with tgt_a tgt_hug tgt_warmly tgt_presents.\"\n\nPutting it all together, we get the translated sentence in Language A:\n\n[at the surprise party the thoughtful friend] [the handmade gift] [with a hug warmly presents].\n\nNow, let's replace the English words with their Language A counterparts:\n\n[tgt_at tgt_the tgt_surprise tgt_party tgt_the tgt_thoughtful tgt_friend] [tgt_the tgt_handmade tgt_gift] [tgt_with tgt_a tgt_hug tgt_warmly tgt_presents].\n\nFinally, we add the full stop at the end to complete the sentence:\n\n[tgt_at tgt_the tgt_surprise tgt_party tgt_the tgt_thoughtful tgt_friend tgt_the tgt_handmade tgt_gift tgt_with tgt_a tgt_hug tgt_warmly tgt_presents .]\n\nSo, the translated sentence in Language A is:\n\n[tgt_at tgt_the tgt_surprise tgt_party tgt_the tgt_thoughtful tgt_friend tgt_the tgt_handmade tgt_gift tgt_with tgt_a tgt_hug tgt_warmly tgt_presents .]"

A prepositional phrase modifying a noun is placed before the noun.\n5. If there are determiners or adjectives modifying the noun, the sentence follows the word order of prepositional phrases, determiners, adjectives, and then the noun.\n\nLet's start by translating the subject phrase \"The skilled carpenters inside the warm workshop\":\n- \"inside the warm workshop\" is a prepositional phrase modifying \"carpenters\"\n- \"The skilled\" are determiners and adjectives modifying \"carpenters\"\n\nAccording to the rules, the prepositional phrase comes first, followed by determiners, adjectives, and then the noun. So we get:\n- \"inside the warm workshop\" -> \"tgt_inside tgt_the tgt_warm tgt_workshop\"\n- \"The skilled carpenters\" -> \"tgt_the tgt_skilled tgt_carpenters\"\n\nNow, let's translate the object phrase \"a sturdy table\":\n- \"a sturdy\" are determiner and adjective modifying \"table\"\n- So we get \"a sturdy table\" -> \"tgt_a tgt_sturdy tgt_table\"\n\nNext, we have the adverb \"expertly\" and the prepositional phrase \"with tools\" modifying the verb \"build\":\n- \"expertly with tools\" -> \"tgt_with tgt_tools tgt_expertly\"\n\nFinally, we put it all together following the Subject-Object-Verb order, with the prepositional phrase and adverb before the verb:\n- Subject: \"tgt_inside tgt_the tgt_warm tgt_workshop tgt_the tgt_skilled tgt_carpenters\"\n- Object: \"tgt_a tgt_sturdy tgt_table\"\n- Verb (with prepositional phrase and adverb): \"tgt_with tgt_tools tgt_expertly tgt_build\"\n\nThe translated sentence in Language A is:\n[tgt_inside tgt_the tgt_warm tgt_workshop tgt_the tgt_skilled tgt_carpenters tgt_a tgt_sturdy tgt_table tgt_with tgt_tools tgt_expertly tgt_build .]"
