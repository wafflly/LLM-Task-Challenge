Prepositional phrases modifying a noun are placed before the noun.\n2. The word order for modifying a noun is prepositional phrases, determiners, adjectives, and then the noun.\n3. Adjectives are repeated twice consecutively.\n4. Prepositional phrases that modify a verb are placed after the verb.\n5. Adverbs that modify a verb are placed after the verb.\n6. The rest of the sentence structure follows English word order.\n\nLet's break down the sentence:\n\n- \"The curious scientist\" becomes \"tgt_the tgt_curious tgt_curious tgt_scientist\" because the adjective \"curious\" is repeated twice.\n- \"in the advanced lab\" modifies \"scientist,\" so it should come before \"scientist\" as \"tgt_in tgt_the tgt_advanced tgt_advanced tgt_lab.\"\n- \"examines\" is translated as \"tgt_examine.\"\n- \"the rare specimen\" becomes \"tgt_the tgt_rare tgt_rare tgt_specimen\" because the adjective \"rare\" is repeated twice.\n- \"closely\" remains after the verb as \"tgt_closely.\"\n- \"with a microscope\" modifies the verb \"examines,\" so it should come after the verb as \"tgt_with tgt_a tgt_microscope.\"\n\nNow, let's put it all together following the rules:\n\n[tgt_in tgt_the tgt_advanced tgt_advanced tgt_lab tgt_the tgt_curious tgt_curious tgt_scientist tgt_examine tgt_the tgt_rare tgt_rare tgt_specimen tgt_closely tgt_with tgt_a tgt_microscope .]\n\nSo the translated sentence in Language A is:\n\n[tgt_in tgt_the tgt_advanced tgt_advanced tgt_lab tgt_the tgt_curious tgt_curious tgt_scientist tgt_examine tgt_the tgt_rare tgt_rare tgt_specimen tgt_closely tgt_with tgt_a tgt_microscope .]"

According to the rules, the prepositional phrase comes first, followed by the determiner, the adjective (repeated twice), and then the noun.\n- \"calculates the annual budget\" has a determiner \"the\", an adjective \"annual\" modifying \"budget\", and the noun \"budget\". The adjective should be repeated twice.\n- \"accurately with software\" has an adverb \"accurately\" modifying the verb \"calculates\" and a prepositional phrase \"with software\" modifying the verb \"calculates\".

For anything not specified, Language A follows the same word order as English.\n\nLet's break down the sentence:\n\n- \"The promising rain from the sky\" has a prepositional phrase \"from the sky\" modifying the noun \"rain\" and an adjective \"promising\" modifying \"rain\". According to the rules, the prepositional phrase comes first, followed by the determiner \"the\", then the adjective \"promising\" repeated twice, and finally the noun \"rain\".\n- \"revives the land\" follows the standard English word order.\n- \"mercifully\" is an adverb modifying the verb \"revives\" and remains after the verb.\n- \"with its raindrops\" has a prepositional phrase \"with its raindrops\" modifying the verb \"revives\" and remains after the verb and adverb.\n\nNow, let's apply the lemma translations:\n\n- the -> tgt_the\n- revive -> tgt_revive\n- raindrop -> tgt_raindrop\n- its -> tgt_its\n- mercifully -> tgt_mercifully\n- sky -> tgt_sky\n- from -> tgt_from\n- rain -> tgt_rain\n- promising -> tgt_promising\n- with -> tgt_with\n- land -> tgt_land\n\nTranslated sentence following the rules:\n\n- \"From the sky the promising promising rain tgt_revives the land tgt_mercifully with tgt_its tgt_raindrops.\"\n\nNow, let's replace the English words with their corresponding lemmas in Language A:\n\n- [tgt_from tgt_the tgt_sky tgt_the tgt_promising tgt_promising tgt_rain tgt_revive tgt_the tgt_land tgt_mercifully tgt_with tgt_its tgt_raindrops .]\n\nThis is the final translated sentence in Language A."
