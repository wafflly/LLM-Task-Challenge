In Language A, the morphological rule for indicating tense involves adding '_-' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate past tense, and adding '_+' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate present tense in a sentence.
Example: 'The cat chased the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_- the dog' for past tense, and 'The cat chases the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_+ the dog' for present tense.
In Language A, each adjective is repeated twice consecutively in a sentence.
Example: 'The black dog chases the cat' is expressed as 'The black black dog chases the cat' with the adjective 'black' repeated twice.

In Language A, the morphological rule for indicating tense involves adding '_-' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate past tense, and adding '_+' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate present tense in a sentence.
Example: 'The cat chased the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_- the dog' for past tense, and 'The cat chases the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_+ the dog' for present tense.
In Language A, each adjective is repeated twice consecutively in a sentence.
Example: 'The black dog chases the cat' is expressed as 'The black black dog chases the cat' with the adjective 'black' repeated twice.

Example: 'These cats in the park' is expressed as 'These P_cat in the park' to represent plural and 'A cat in the park' is expressed as 'A S_cat in the park' to represent singular.
In Language A, the morphological rule for indicating tense involves adding '_-' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate past tense, and adding '_+' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate present tense in a sentence.
Example: 'The cat chased the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_- the dog' for past tense, and 'The cat chases the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_+ the dog' for present tense.
In Language A, each adjective is repeated twice consecutively in a sentence.
Example: 'The black dog chases the cat' is expressed as 'The black black dog chases the cat' with the adjective 'black' repeated twice.

In Language A, each adjective is repeated twice consecutively in a sentence.
Example: 'The black dog chases the cat' is expressed as 'The black black dog chases the cat' with the adjective 'black' repeated twice.
Here are the translated pairs of English lemmas into lemmas in language A: { (the, tgt_the), (efficient, tgt_efficient), (barista, tgt_barista), (in, tgt_in), (the, tgt_the), (crowded, tgt_crowded), (café, tgt_café), (prepare, tgt_prepare), (the, tgt_the), (hot, tgt_hot), (coffee, tgt_coffee), (quickly, tgt_quickly), (for, tgt_for), (the, tgt_the), (morning, tgt_morning), (rush, tgt_rush), (., .) }.

In Language A, the morphological rule for nouns involves indicating a singular noun by adding 'S_' as a prefix to its lemma, and indicating a plural noun by adding 'P_' as a prefix to its lemma.
Example: 'These cats in the park' is expressed as 'These P_cat in the park' to represent plural and 'A cat in the park' is expressed as 'A S_cat in the park' to represent singular.
In Language A, the morphological rule for indicating tense involves adding '_-' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate past tense, and adding '_+' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate present tense in a sentence.
Example: 'The cat chased the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_- the dog' for past tense, and 'The cat chases the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_+ the dog' for present tense.
In Language A, each adjective is repeated twice consecutively in a sentence.
Example: 'The black dog chases the cat' is expressed as 'The black black dog chases the cat' with the adjective 'black' repeated twice.
Here are the translated pairs of English lemmas into lemmas in language A: { (the, tgt_the), (promising, tgt_promising), (rain, tgt_rain), (from, tgt_from), (the, tgt_the), (sky, tgt_sky), (revive, tgt_revive), (the, tgt_the), (land, tgt_land), (mercifully, tgt_mercifully), (with, tgt_with), (its, tgt_its), (raindrop, tgt_raindrop), (., .) }.
