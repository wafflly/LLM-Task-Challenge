Prompts:  The following are the linguistic rules of Language A.
In Language A, the canonical word order of sentences follow a Subject-Object-Verb structure.
Example: 'The cat eats the mouse' should be ordered as 'The cat the mouse eats'.
In Language A, a prepositional phrase modifying a verb is placed before the verb. If there is an adverb modifying the verb, the sentence follows the word order of prepositional phrase, adverb, and then the verb.
Example: 'The black cat drinks water slowly with its mouth' should be ordered as 'The black cat with its mouth slowly drinks water'.
In Language A, a prepositional phrase modifying a noun is placed before the noun. If there are determiners or adjectives modifying the noun, the sentence follows the word order of prepositional phrases, determiners, adjectives, and then the noun.
Example: 'The black cat in the park chases the dog' should be ordered as 'In the park the black cat chases the dog'.
In Language A, the morphological rule for nouns involves indicating a singular noun by adding 'S_' as a prefix to its lemma, and indicating a plural noun by adding 'P_' as a prefix to its lemma.

For anything not explicitly specified, Language A follows the same word order as English.

Here are the translated pairs of English lemmas into lemmas in language A: { (for, tgt_for), (dedicated, tgt_dedicated), (in, tgt_in), (community, tgt_community), (organize, tgt_organize), (selflessly, tgt_selflessly), (., .), (center, tgt_center), (event, tgt_event), (charity, tgt_charity), (cause, tgt_cause), (the, tgt_the), (volunteer, tgt_volunteer) }.
Translate the following simple sentence into Language A: "The dedicated volunteer in the community center organizes the charity event selflessly for the cause .".

In Language A, a prepositional phrase modifying a verb is placed before the verb. If there is an adverb modifying the verb, the sentence follows the word order of prepositional phrase, adverb, and then the verb.
Example: 'The black cat drinks water slowly with its mouth' should be ordered as 'The black cat with its mouth slowly drinks water'.
In Language A, a prepositional phrase modifying a noun is placed before the noun. If there are determiners or adjectives modifying the noun, the sentence follows the word order of prepositional phrases, determiners, adjectives, and then the noun.
Example: 'The black cat in the park chases the dog' should be ordered as 'In the park the black cat chases the dog'.
In Language A, the morphological rule for indicating tense involves adding '_-' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate past tense, and adding '_+' as a suffix to the lemma of a verb to indicate present tense in a sentence.
Example: 'The cat chased the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_- the dog' for past tense, and 'The cat chases the dog' is expressed as 'The cat chase_+ the dog' for present tense.
For anything not explicitly specified, Language A follows the same word order as English.

Here are the translated pairs of English lemmas into lemmas in language A: { (with, tgt_with), (rare, tgt_rare), (in, tgt_in), (of, tgt_of), (concerto, tgt_concerto), (talented, tgt_talented), (front, tgt_front), (audience, tgt_audience), (play, tgt_play), (., .), (violin, tgt_violin), (passionately, tgt_passionately), (the, tgt_the), (girl, tgt_girl) }.
Translate the following simple sentence into Language A: "The talented girl with the rare violin plays the concerto passionately in front of the audience .".
Please put the final translated result in brackets [] at the end of your response, for example, [tgt_the tgt_cat tgt_the tgt_dog tgt_chases].
